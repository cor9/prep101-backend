<h1>LUNA'S CLOUD KINGDOM<br>
<small>Audition Preparation Guide for UNLIKED TV Series</small></h1>

<div class="intro-hook">
This scene is DYNAMITE! You're not just playing the quirky kid - you're playing a young philosopher who sees magic in everything. Luna doesn't live in the real world because she's discovered something better than reality.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>

<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> TV Series - UNLIKED [evidence] → "tv-series"</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Not stated in sides</p>

<p><strong>Comparable Projects:</strong> Not stated in sides</p>
<p><strong>Scene Context:</strong> A typical morning battle between pragmatic parenting and Luna's unique worldview [evidence] → "The bus comes in ten minutes"</p>

<div class="luna-magic">

</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN - THE REAL LUNA</h2>

<h3>Who is Luna? (Beyond "Dreamy Kid")</h3>
<p>Luna is a 13-year-old natural philosopher [evidence] → "Luna (13)" who has developed an intricate understanding of how the universe works. She's not spacey - she's operating on a higher frequency where everything is connected and meaningful. [evidence] → "sees connections no one else does"</p>

<h3>How She Sees Herself:</h3>
<p>The interpreter of signs, the protector of living things (including cheese cultures), and the bridge between the human and natural worlds. She genuinely believes she's being helpful and wise.</p>

<h3>How Others See Her:</h3>
<p>Her mother sees her as [evidence] → "Sweet, genuinely spacey" but also exhausting. Teachers like Mrs. Patterson see her as disruptive. But Luna doesn't understand why everyone else can't see what's obviously true.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Character Gold Mine:</strong> Luna's character description says she's like [evidence] → "young Phoebe Buffay meets a girl who might actually talk to squirrels." This isn't random quirkiness - this is a girl who sees life as one big interconnected story.
</div>

<h3>Your Bridge to Luna:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever seen shapes in clouds that were completely obvious to you?</li>
<li>Do you notice patterns and connections that others miss?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt like adults don't listen to important things?</li>
<li>Do you have your own logic that makes perfect sense to you?</li>
<li>Have you ever tried to protect something others thought was silly?</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Empathy Stretch:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Luna's worldview is completely consistent within itself</li>
<li>She genuinely believes she's helping and protecting others</li>
<li>She doesn't understand why others can't see what she sees</li>
<li>Her confidence in her perspective is absolute</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3. UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (LUNA EDITION)</h2>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm Luna, age 13, interpreter of nature's messages and protector of all living things (including cheese cultures). I understand how everything in the universe connects, and I try to share this wisdom with others - though they don't always appreciate it.</p>

<h3>Where am I?</h3>
<p>In my living room [evidence] → "A living room" - my safe space where I can observe the outside world and receive important messages from clouds and other natural phenomena.</p>

<h3>What time is it?</h3>
<p>Morning, specifically [evidence] → "The bus comes in ten minutes" - but time moves differently when you're receiving important cosmic information.</p>

<h3>What surrounds me?</h3>
<p>The window with its view of the ever-changing cloud messages, my patient but confused mother, and the pressure of the "normal" world trying to pull me away from important spiritual work.</p>

<h3>What are the relationships?</h3>
<p>Mom is my loving but skeptical caretaker who doesn't understand that I'm trying to keep us both safe by listening to nature's warnings. She thinks I'm being difficult when I'm actually being responsible.</p>

<h3>What are the circumstances?</h3>
<p>I've received a clear warning from the cloud formations about danger at school today [evidence] → "Wolf chases bunny. Bunny is me. Wolf is... school." This is serious information that requires immediate action.</p>

<h3>What do I want?</h3>
<p>To keep myself safe by heeding nature's warning, and to help my mother understand that the natural world is trying to communicate with us if we just listen.</p>

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
<p>Mom's inability to see the obvious cloud messages, society's rules about school attendance, and everyone's general blindness to the interconnected nature of reality.</p>

<h3>How do I get what I want?</h3>
<p>By explaining the clear logic of the situation, by sharing my other discoveries (like talking to birds), and by being patient with Mom's learning process.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4. SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY - THIS IS GOLD!</h2>

<h3>The Physical Journey:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening stillness:</strong> [evidence] → "completely still. Almost unnervingly so" - You're in deep communion with nature</li>
<li><strong>The turn:</strong> [evidence] → "finally turning, very serious" - This is when you shift from receiving to teaching</li>
<li><strong>Demonstration mode:</strong> [evidence] → "pointing" - You become an active guide to the cloud messages</li>
<li><strong>Excitement moments:</strong> [evidence] → "brightening," "gasps, delighted," "excited, rapid" - When you connect with mom</li>
<li><strong>Resignation:</strong> [evidence] → "deflating," "sighing dramatically" - When the adult world wins again</li>
</ul>

<div class="physical-note">
<strong>Physical Gold Alert:</strong> Luna's body language should show she's completely comfortable in her own reality. She's never self-conscious about her beliefs - she's confident and matter-of-fact about cosmic truths.
</div>

<h3>Key Physical Moments:</h3>
<p><strong>The Cloud Pointing:</strong> Make this very specific and clear - you can see exactly what you're pointing to</p>
<p><strong>The Excited Bird Talk:</strong> [evidence] → "excited, rapid" - This is pure joy at finding someone who might understand</p>
<p><strong>The Reassuring Pat:</strong> [evidence] → "She pats her mom's arm reassuringly" - You're the wise one comforting the confused adult</p>

<div class="comedy-gold">
<strong>Comedy Strategy:</strong> The humor comes from Luna's absolute certainty about things that sound absurd. She's never joking or trying to be funny - she's being completely sincere about cosmic truths.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL LAYERS</h2>

<h3>What Luna's REALLY Saying:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Can't go to school today, Mom"</strong> = <em>I've received important safety information that you need to take seriously</em></li>
<li><strong>"The clouds told me not to"</strong> = <em>This isn't whim - this is legitimate guidance from nature</em></li>
<li><strong>"Clouds don't have mouths, Mom"</strong> = <em>Obviously. I'm not crazy - I understand how communication actually works</em></li>
<li><strong>"You never listen to nature"</strong> = <em>You're missing out on so much wisdom because you don't pay attention</em></li>
<li><strong>"You talk to birds too?!"</strong> = <em>Finally! I knew you had the potential to understand!</em></li>
<li><strong>"That's what they want YOU to think"</strong> = <em>You're being manipulated by conventional wisdom</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Emotional Arc:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Peaceful Reception</strong> → <strong>Serious Teaching</strong> (sharing the cloud warning)</li>
<li><strong>Patient Explanation</strong> → <strong>Joyful Connection</strong> (when mom mentions birds)</li>
<li><strong>Reluctant Compliance</strong> → <strong>Continued Wisdom Sharing</strong> (still trying to educate)</li>
<li><strong>Casual Revelation</strong> → <strong>Matter-of-fact Exit</strong> (dropping the cheese bomb)</li>
</ol>

<div class="bold-choice">
<strong>Secret Weapon:</strong> Luna is never defensive about her beliefs because she knows she's right. This confidence makes her absolutely magnetic and prevents the character from becoming pathetic or annoying.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6. BOLD ACTING CHOICES - MAKE THIS UNFORGETTABLE</h2>

<div class="bold-choice">
<h3>The Trap vs. The Truth:</h3>
<p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Playing Luna as "weird kid being random"</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Playing Luna as "young philosopher sharing cosmic wisdom"</p>
</div>

<h3>Three-Take Approach:</h3>

<h4>Take 1: The Natural Choice</h4>
<p>Luna as gentle, dreamy sage - soft-spoken but certain, like a young guru sharing ancient wisdom with loving patience.</p>

<h4>Take 2: The Bold Choice</h4>
<p>Luna with more urgency and authority - she's not just sharing interesting observations, she's trying to prevent actual danger. More intense about the cloud warnings.</p>

<h4>Take 3: The Vulnerable Choice</h4>
<p>Luna showing slight hurt when mom doesn't understand - she genuinely wants to connect and share these amazing discoveries, and there's real emotion when she's dismissed.</p>

<h3>Key Emotional Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening Stillness:</strong> Deep meditation/reception mode</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Explanation:</strong> Teacher mode - patient but urgent</li>
<li><strong>Bird Discovery:</strong> Pure joy at potential connection</li>
<li><strong>Final Cheese Revelation:</strong> Casual dropping of earth-shattering information</li>
</ul>

<div class="coach-note">
<strong>Pro Direction:</strong> Never play Luna as if she knows her ideas sound strange. In her reality, talking about cloud messages is as normal as discussing the weather. Your conviction sells the comedy and the character.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>7. ACTING CHOICES TO MAKE</h2>

<h3>Vocal Choices:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dreamy authority:</strong> [evidence] → "dreamy, not turning" but also serious and certain</li>
<li><strong>Matter-of-fact wisdom:</strong> [evidence] → "very matter-of-fact" - stating cosmic truths like obvious facts</li>
<li><strong>Excited discovery:</strong> [evidence] → "excited, rapid" when finding connection</li>
<li><strong>Casual revelation:</strong> [evidence] → "completely casual" when dropping the cheese bombshell</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pitfalls to Avoid:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't play "crazy" - Luna is completely sane within her worldview</li>
<li>Don't be self-aware of the absurdity - to Luna, this is all logical</li>
<li>Don't make it precious or overly cute - Luna has real authority</li>
<li>Don't rush through the explanations - Luna wants to be understood</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gold Acting Moments:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cloud Turn:</strong> [evidence] → "finally turning, very serious" - The shift from receiver to teacher</li>
<li><strong>The Bird Gasp:</strong> [evidence] → "gasps, delighted" - Genuine excitement at potential connection</li>
<li><strong>The Reassuring Pat:</strong> [evidence] → "pats her mom's arm reassuringly" - Luna comforting the confused adult</li>
<li><strong>The Cheese Drop:</strong> [evidence] → "completely casual" - Earth-shattering news delivered like weather report</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>8. WHY THIS SCENE WORKS - AND HOW TO NAIL IT</h2>

<h3>The Comedy Structure:</h3>
<p>This scene builds perfectly from simple cloud observation to cosmic philosophy to cheese rescue operations. Each revelation is bigger and more absurd, but Luna treats them all with equal seriousness.</p>

<h3>The Relationship Dynamic:</h3>
<p>Luna and Mom have a loving relationship where mom has learned to navigate Luna's worldview [evidence] → "patient, loving mother." But Luna doesn't see herself as difficult - she sees herself as helpful.</p>

<h3>The Stakes:</h3>
<p>For Luna, this isn't about avoiding school - it's about preventing actual danger based on legitimate cosmic warnings. The stakes couldn't be higher in her mind.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Scene Gold Mine:</strong> The genius of this writing is that Luna's logic is actually consistent. Clouds are water, she's mostly water, therefore she's part cloud. It's weird but it makes sense within her system.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>9. MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON</h2>

<h3>Your Moment Before:</h3>
<p>You've been sitting in perfect communion with the cloud formations, receiving clear warnings about today's dangers. You're in a state of calm certainty about what needs to happen next. This is important spiritual work.</p>

<h3>The Button Options:</h3>
<p>After your exit with [evidence] → "completely casual" cheese revelation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Satisfied confidence - you've successfully educated mom about multiple cosmic truths today</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Slight concern - you hope mom will remember to call Mrs. Patterson about the cheese situation</li>
<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Continued wisdom - maybe pause to check the clouds one more time before leaving</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>10. SELF-TAPE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE</h2>

<h3>Framing and Movement:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start seated, facing camera at an angle (looking toward window)</li>
<li>Make the turn to mom a clear, deliberate movement</li>
<li>Use pointing gestures that we can see clearly</li>
<li>Show the physical excitement when discussing birds</li>
<li>End with confident exit energy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eye Line Management:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Window/clouds: Look past camera, slightly up</li>
<li>Mom: Consistent eye line to one side of camera</li>
<li>When pointing at clouds, make it specific and visible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Energy Management:</h3>
<p>This scene has multiple energy shifts - from meditative stillness to excited teaching to casual revelation. Map these out and make each shift clear and motivated.</p>
</div>

<div class="prep-checklist">
<h2>YOUR LUNA ACTION PLAN</h2>
<ul>
<li>☐ Practice the opening stillness - find your version of communion with nature</li>
<li>☐ Work on the "very serious" turn - this is Luna's teaching mode activation</li>
<li>☐ Map out your cloud pointing - make the shapes real and specific</li>
<li>☐ Find your version of excited, rapid bird discussion</li>
<li>☐ Practice the reassuring pat - Luna comforting the confused adult</li>
<li>☐ Master the casual cheese revelation - earth-shaking news delivered matter-of-factly</li>
<li>☐ Work on never doubting Luna's logic - she's always completely certain</li>
<li>☐ Practice maintaining Luna's authority throughout</li>
<li>☐ Remember: Luna is helping, not being difficult</li>
<li>☐ Connect to your own moments of seeing patterns others miss</li>
</ul>

<div class="luna-magic" style="margin-top: 25px;">
<p><strong>Final Pep Talk:</strong> Luna isn't just the "quirky kid" - she's a young philosopher who sees magic and meaning in everything. Your job is to make us believe that talking to clouds is not only possible but completely logical. Show them a Luna who makes us wish we could see the world through her eyes. This character could be iconic - she's that special blend of wisdom and wonder that makes audiences fall in love. The clouds have spoken, and they're telling you to book this role!</p>
