CHARACTER BREAKDOWN
Who is Bianca?
Bianca di Angelo is a 15-year-old girl caught between worlds – literally and guratively. Born in
the 1930s but displaced in time (though she doesn't fully understand this yet), she's a protective
older sister trying to navigate a new school environment while looking after her 12-year-old
brother Nico. She's an outsider with vintage style (that "way out of style" oppy green hat and
dress) who orbits social groups without truly belonging. Though she appears meek at rst glance,
she reveals a erce protective instinct and surprising physical courage when standing up to
bullies.

How does Bianca see herself?
Bianca likely sees herself primarily as her brother's protector and guardian. Her identity is
wrapped up in being responsible for Nico, often at the expense of her own needs and desires.
She's self-conscious about her outdated style (note her reaction to Annabeth's "vintage"
comment) and aware that she doesn't quite t in. She feels caught between trying to make friends
and ful lling her duty to watch over Nico. There's a weariness to her – she's been carrying this
responsibility for so long that she barely knows who she is outside of being "Nico's sister."

How do others see Bianca?

Zoë: Recognizes something special in her – a potential hunter of Artemis material
Nico: Depends on her but may be starting to chafe under her protectiveness
Authority gures: May view her with suspicion due to her protective nature being
misinterpreted as aggression

UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (CUSTOMIZED)
Who am I?
I am Bianca di Angelo, 15 years old, older sister to Nico, out of place and time. I was born in the
1930s but don't fully understand this yet. I have fuzzy memories of a previous life but can't quite
place them. I've been caring for my brother for as long as I can remember. I'm a demigod, though
I'm just discovering this. I'm quiet but brave when needed, preferring to observe rather than
participate. I wear outdated clothes and have a serious, responsible demeanor that makes me
seem older than my years.

Where am I?
In the rst scene, I'm in a school gymnasium at night during what appears to be a social
gathering. I'm trailing on the edges of a group, not fully participating. Later scenes take place in
different parts of the gymnasium and eventually in snowy woods outside what appears to be a
camp.

What time is it?

It's nighttime during the school year, likely winter based on the later snow scene. For Bianca,
time is confusing – she's actually from the 1930s but has been in the Lotus Casino where time
moves differently.

It's nighttime during the school year, likely winter based on the later snow scene. For Bianca,
time is confusing – she's actually from the 1930s but has been in the Lotus Casino where time
moves differently.

What surrounds me?
In the gym: other students, social groups, bleachers, a sense of being evaluated. Later: snow,
cold, woods, uncertainty, but also the beginning of understanding my true nature.

What are the relationships?
•
•
•
•
•
•

Nico (brother): I am his protector, guardian, and only family. I love him deeply but
sometimes resent the responsibility.
Annabeth: A potential new friend who seems to understand what it's like to be different.
Percy: Someone connected to Annabeth who seems to understand something about me
and my brother that I don't yet.
Zoë: A mysterious gure who sees something in me I don't fully recognize myself.
The Bullies: Threats to my brother that bring out my protective instincts.
Thorn/Authority Figures: Adults who don't understand or believe me.

What are the circumstances?
I've recently arrived at a new school with my brother. We have no parents and unclear origins.
I'm trying to protect Nico while also nding my own place. I'm discovering that we're not normal
teenagers but demigods with divine parentage, which explains why we've always felt different.
There are supernatural threats emerging around us.

What do I want?
•
•
•
•

Scene 1: To protect Nico from bullies and maintain his dignity.
Scene 2: To connect with a potential friend while navigating social awkwardness.
Scene 3: To defend my brother against false accusations.
Scene 4: To understand my true nature and parentage while keeping Nico safe.

What's in my way?
•
•
•
•
•

My social awkwardness and outdated understanding of teen culture
The responsibility of being Nico's sole protector
My incomplete understanding of my own history and identity
Bullies and authority gures who misunderstand my actions
My hesitation to put myself rst or make connections

How do I get what I want?
•
•
•
•
•

Direct confrontation with bullies when necessary
Vulnerability with potential friends like Annabeth
Standing my ground against authority gures
Asking questions about my parentage and identity
Physical action when words fail (shoving the bully)

SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY

SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY
Bianca's physicality reveals her character in powerful ways:
•
•
•

•
•

•
•

Trailing vs. Beelining: Notice how she "trails on the periphery" of social groups but
makes a "beeline" for Nico when he's in trouble. Her body language shows con dence
only when protecting her brother.
The Protective Stance: When confronting the bully, position yourself between them and
your imaginary Nico. Make your body a shield. Your hands might be slightly raised,
ready to act.
Self-Conscious Moments: When Annabeth comments on your dress, look down at
yourself with a mixture of embarrassment and resignation. This is a moment to physically
shrink slightly.
The Shove: This is a pivotal moment showing Bianca's surprising strength. Make it
decisive and quick – not tentative. This isn't a girl who's uncertain when protecting her
brother.
Pulling Nico Close: In the snow scene, the physical act of pulling your brother close
shows both protection and affection. Your body should curl slightly around his imaginary
form.
Eye Contact Patterns: Bianca likely maintains strong eye contact when defending Nico
but may have more hesitant, darting eye contact in social situations with peers.
The Floppy Hat Adjustment: Consider a small gesture of adjusting your imaginary hat
when feeling self-conscious – a defensive mechanism that provides comfort.

SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL DEPTH
Bianca's dialogue often carries deeper meaning:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

"Do we have a problem?" = "Back away from my brother or face consequences."
"I was talking to the tough guy who took your cards." = "I see through your false
bravado, and I'm not intimidated."
"I think you think you are." = "You're not as tough as you pretend to be, and I'm
calling your bluff."
"I suppose..." (about her dress) = "I'm uncomfortable with attention on my appearance
and don't know how to respond to compliments."
"We've always had to look out for each other." = "We have no one else in the world
but each other."
"He doesn't remember our parents. I do." = "I carry memories and pain that he doesn't
have to bear."
"Neither mother nor father seemed like a..." = "I've been questioning the story of our
parentage for some time."
"So are we." = "I'm beginning to accept that I might be special too."

Emotional Beats to Find:
Resignation → Determination when leaving the social group to help Nico
Controlled anger → Satisfaction when confronting the bullies

Controlled anger → Satisfaction when confronting the bullies
Hurt → Isolation when the girls move away after the confrontation
Awkward → Hopeful when connecting with Annabeth
Defensive → Vulnerable when discussing your parents
Skeptical → Awed in your nal interaction with Zoë

CHARACTER POV & PERSONALIZATION
Bianca views the world through a uniquely protective lens. She evaluates every situation rst by
asking "Is Nico safe?" before considering her own needs or desires. This worldview comes from
years of being the only constant in her brother's life.
Her perspective is also colored by displacement – both cultural (from being in the Lotus Casino
where time moved differently) and temporal (being from the 1930s). This gives her an oldfashioned sensibility that makes her seem mature beyond her years but socially awkward with
contemporary teens.
To personalize Bianca:
•
•
•
•

Think about what it would be like to have hazy memories of a different era
Consider how responsibility ages a person and creates a seriousness
Explore what it feels like to want friendship but put duty rst
Connect to the experience of being an outsider trying to protect someone you love

BOLD ACTING CHOICES
To avoid a one-note performance, nd opportunities for contrast and surprise:

Vocal Choices:
•
•
•
•

When addressing bullies, nd a lower, more commanding register than your normal
speaking voice
With Nico, allow moments of gentle sisterly warmth
With Annabeth, show hesitation and social awkwardness
With Zoë, mix wonder and defensiveness

Physical Contrasts:
•
•
•

Create a distinction between "public Bianca" (stiff, self-conscious) and "protective
Bianca" (decisive, powerful)
Find moments where your fatigue with constant vigilance shows through
Demonstrate both physical courage (shoving the bully) and emotional vulnerability
(discussing parents)

Surprising Elements:

in you

MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON
Moment Before (Scene 1):
Imagine Bianca has spent the evening trying to blend in with a group of girls, making awkward
attempts at conversation while keeping one eye on Nico. She's exhausted from the social effort
but determined to make it work. When she spots the bullies targeting Nico, there's both
frustration (her social efforts ruined again) and relief (returning to her comfort zone of protecting
him).

Button (Scene 1):
After the confrontation, as everyone stares at her, consider a moment where Bianca straightens
her outdated hat with dignity – a small gesture that says "I know I don't belong, but I stand by
what I did."

Moment Before (Scene 4):
Before the snow scene, imagine Bianca has just learned about being a demigod. She's processing
this revelation while still trying to protect Nico from this new reality. She's cold, confused, but
also experiencing a strange sense of things nally making sense.

Button (Scene 4):
After saying "So are we," let a sense of wonder and possibility wash over you. This is Bianca
glimpsing that she might be more than just "Nico's protector" – she might have an identity and
destiny of her own.

REHEARSAL & EXPERIMENTATION
Run-Through Strategies:

The Protector Run: Focus entirely on Bianca's protective instincts, making every choice
about Nico's safety.
The Outsider Run: Emphasize her social awkwardness and displacement, the feeling of
being from another time.
The Discovery Run: Play each scene as a step in discovering her true identity, with
growing curiosity about her origins.

The Discovery Run: Play each scene as a step in discovering her true identity, with
growing curiosity about her origins.
The Tired Guardian Run: Show the weight of responsibility and how it has exhausted
her over time.

Tactical Variations:
•
•
•
•

Try one run where you use humor as a defense mechanism
Try another where you're more physically imposing when confronting the bullies
Experiment with different levels of social awkwardness with Annabeth
Play with varying degrees of awe/skepticism toward Zoë

Alternative Takes:
For a second choice/alternative read, consider:
•

A more awkward, nervous Bianca who stands up to bullies through shaky determination
rather than natural con dence
A Bianca who uses sharp wit and verbal skills rather than physical confrontation
A Bianca who shows more visible excitement about the possibility of divine parentage

PREPARATION CHECKLIST
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Read through all scenes identifying Bianca's objectives and obstacles
Create a quick character timeline (what happened before these scenes)
Identify 3-5 speci c physical traits for Bianca
Practice speaking in Bianca's voice, nding her unique rhythm
Prepare "moment before" for each scene
Run each scene 10+ times with different emotional approaches
Record yourself and review for moments that feel authentic vs. forced
Memorize sides completely so you can focus on emotional truth
Create two distinct versions of the character for alternative takes
Prepare questions about the character/context if you have a callback

FINAL COACHING NOTES
Bianca exists in a liminal space – between childhood and adulthood, between past and present,
between duty and desire. The most compelling version of this character will show all these
tensions without overplaying any of them.
Remember that the most powerful moments often come in the silence between lines – when
Bianca processes what she's learning about herself, when she makes the choice to confront
bullies, when she realizes others see something special in her.
Don't play her as a saint or a martyr – she loves her brother but likely resents the responsibility
sometimes. Find those complex, contradictory human moments that make characters threedimensional.

Most importantly, bring your unique understanding of feeling different, of caring for others, of
wanting to belong while standing apart. That authentic emotional connection will make Bianca
real, relatable, and memorable.
