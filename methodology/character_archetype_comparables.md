## 1. The Accidentally Brutally Honest Kid

**Also Known As:** The Truth Bomb, The Innocent Revealer, The Unfiltered Angel

**Core Trait:** Sincere, unfiltered honesty delivered without awareness of social consequences. The comedy or drama comes from the gap between what they say and what everyone else is too polite to mention.

**Age Range:** 5-12 (most effective), can extend to early teens for comedic roles

**Common Genres:** Comedy, Family, Sitcom, Dramedy

**Emotional Range:** Earnest → Confused (when others react) → Defensive → Doubling Down

### Comparables to Study

**Adult/Teen References:**
- Leslie Knope (*Parks and Recreation*) — Earnest conviction without self-censorship
- Buddy the Elf (*Elf*) — Joyful truth-telling with zero malice
- Kate McKinnon's SNL characters — Commitment to the bit without breaking
- Extroverted Luna Lovegood (*Harry Potter*) — Stating the obvious that no one else will

**Kid/Tween References:**
- Darcy (*The Bad Guys*) — Wide-eyed observations that cut to the core
- Olive (*Little Miss Sunshine*) — Asking questions adults don't want to answer
- Summer (*School of Rock*) — Calling out what's not working, matter-of-factly
- Ana (*Club Mundo Kids*) — Cultural observations delivered with pure innocence
- Young Phoebe (*Stuck in the Middle*) — Blurting family secrets at the worst moments
- Devi's cousin (*Never Have I Ever*) — Brutal assessments with a smile

### How to Play It

The secret sauce here is **zero sarcasm**. You're not *trying* to be funny or cutting—you genuinely don't understand why stating the obvious is a problem. Your eyebrows don't raise knowingly. Your tone doesn't dip into irony. You're just... saying what's true.

**Physical Life:**
- Direct eye contact (you have nothing to hide)
- Slightly forward posture (engaged, eager)
- Genuine confusion when people react badly
- Head tilts when processing why everyone's upset

**Vocal Approach:**
- Steady, matter-of-fact delivery
- No rising inflection that signals you're seeking approval
- Volume stays consistent—you're not announcing, just stating

### Audition Tactics

1. **Resist the temptation to "play the joke."** If the line is funny, let it land through sincerity, not timing.
2. **Build in the "realization gap."** After dropping a truth bomb, take a beat before registering others' reactions.
3. **Find the positive intention.** Even when saying something cutting, your character believes they're being helpful.

### Related Archetypes
→ The Dreamy Quirky Outsider (when truth-telling comes from different perception)  
→ The Overly Mature Old Soul (when delivered with world-weariness instead of innocence)

## 2. The Dreamy, Quirky Outsider

**Also Known As:** The Imaginative Wanderer, The Gentle Weirdo, The Internal World-Builder

**Core Trait:** Lives in a rich internal world with its own logic. Sees wonder, patterns, and connections that others miss. Not trying to be different—they simply *are* different.

**Age Range:** 6-16

**Common Genres:** Fantasy, Drama, Indie Film, Animation, Coming-of-Age

**Emotional Range:** Wonder → Gentle Confusion → Deep Knowing → Quiet Hurt (when dismissed)

### Comparables to Study

- Riley (*Inside Out*) — Rich emotional inner landscape
- Bruno (young) (*Encanto*) — Seeing truths others don't want to see
- Fern (*Charlotte's Web*) — Forming connections others find strange

### How to Play It

**Softness + specificity.** You're not playing "vague and floaty"—your character has an incredibly *specific* way of seeing the world. They notice the beetle on the sidewalk, the sound the refrigerator makes, the way shadows look like sleeping cats.

**Physical Life:**
- Slightly delayed reactions (processing through their own filter first)
- Eyes that track things others don't notice
- Gentle, unhurried movements
- Comfort with stillness and silence

**Vocal Approach:**
- Thoughtful pauses mid-sentence (not for effect, but because you're *seeing* something)
- Unexpected emphasis on unusual words
- Genuine warmth when sharing observations

### Audition Tactics

1. **Create the internal movie.** Before you speak, *see* what your character sees. The specificity will read.
2. **Don't apologize for being different.** No self-conscious smiles. Your character isn't aware they're unusual.
3. **Find the logic.** Every "random" observation should connect to something real for your character.

### Related Archetypes

→ The Tender Outsider (more emotional, less whimsical)

## 3. The Wounded Teen With Walls

**Also Known As:** The Guarded Heart, The Cool Exterior, The Secretly Hurting

- Will Byers (*Stranger Things*) — Trauma manifesting as quiet withdrawal
- Claudia (*Interview with the Vampire*) — Ancient wounds in young form

### How to Play It

**Guard up. Vulnerability leaks through in small, accidental moments.**

The key is that your character *doesn't want* to show their pain. Every time emotion breaks through, it costs them something. They might cover with a joke, a shrug, looking away, or changing the subject.

**Physical Life:**
- Crossed arms, angled body, reduced eye contact
- Tension in jaw, shoulders, hands
- Moments of stillness that mask internal storms
- Small "tells" when walls crack (swallow, look away, hand to face)

**Vocal Approach:**
- Controlled, even delivery (keeping emotion in check)
- Sarcasm or humor as deflection
- Voice might tighten or drop when approaching real feelings
- Pauses before vulnerable admissions

### Audition Tactics

1. **Know the wound.** Even if it's not in the sides, decide what hurt this character. Play the protection of *that specific wound*.
2. **Make vulnerability expensive.** When the mask slips, let us see how hard it is to be exposed.
3. **Find the one person/thing that gets through.** Walls are most interesting when we see what (or who) can break them down.

### Related Archetypes
→ The Young Rebel With a Golden Heart (more active/angry defense)  
→ The Soft-Spoken Shadow (quieter expression)  
→ The Guest-Star Trauma Kid (similar emotional depth, different context)

## 4. The Fish Out of Water

**Age Range:** 6-18

### How to Play It

**Play the confidence honestly.** You're not *trying* to be funny—you genuinely believe your approach should work. The comedy comes from the collision between your certainty and reality.

**Physical Life:**
- Start with your character's "home base" physicality
- Genuine confusion when your normal approach fails
- Gradual, sometimes reluctant adaptation
- Moments of triumph when your unique skills *do* apply

**Vocal Approach:**
- Initially confident, matter-of-fact
- Frustration when not understood
- Explaining your logic as if it's obvious
- Genuine delight when connecting

### Audition Tactics

1. **Know where your character IS comfortable.** Play the contrast—show us their competence so the mismatch lands.
2. **Don't play dumb.** You're not stupid—you're smart in the *wrong way* for this situation.
3. **Find the genuine adaptation.** By the end, something should shift. Show growth.

### Related Archetypes
→ The Confident Weird Kid (difference is internal, not circumstantial)  
→ The Eager Apprentice (wants to fit in vs. confident in difference)

## 5. The Tiny CEO / Mini Powerhouse

**Also Known As:** The Kid in Charge, The Little General, The Pint-Sized Authority

- Lilo (*Lilo & Stitch*) — Unconventional leadership of her ohana

### How to Play It

**Lead the scene. Make decisions quickly and confidently.**

You're not asking for permission. You're not checking if it's okay. You've assessed the situation and you're implementing the solution. Adults are either tools in your plan or obstacles to route around.

**Physical Life:**
- Taking up space despite small stature
- Direct, sustained eye contact
- Decisive gestures (pointing, organizing, directing)
- Posture of someone who expects to be obeyed

**Vocal Approach:**
- Clear, declarative statements
- Little vocal fry or uncertainty
- Comfortable with silence (you've said what needs saying)
- Not loud—authority doesn't require volume

### Audition Tactics

1. **Never play small.** Your character has earned their authority through competence. Own it.
2. **Find the vulnerability underneath.** The best Tiny CEOs have a reason they need control—isolation, fear, love.
3. **Let adults be obstacles.** React to not being taken seriously with strategy, not tantrums.

### Related Archetypes
→ The Overly Mature Old Soul (similar authority, different flavor—more exhausted)  
→ The Mini Detective (similar intelligence, more curious than commanding)  
→ The Budding Genius (similar smarts, less social command)

## 6. The Narrator / The Observer

### How to Play It

**Physical Life:**
- Stillness, especially when others are moving
- Eyes that track and absorb
- Slight delay before physical reactions
- Occasional knowing looks (to camera or to self)

**Vocal Approach:**
- Measured, considered delivery

**Physical Life:**

- Physical comfort toward others (appropriate touch, proximity)

**Underplay everything. Deliver lines flat, wise, and observant.**

You've already figured out what the adults are still working on. You're not impressed. You're not surprised. You've *seen this before*—if not literally, then emotionally. The comedy comes from your exhaustion, not your enthusiasm.

**Physical Life:**

### How to Play It

**Big swings, quick pacing, expressive face and body.**

You're not at an 8—you're at 11. But here's the key: it's not *fake* enthusiasm. It's genuine excitement that just happens to be... a lot. Everything is the best thing ever. Every setback is a momentary tragedy. Every recovery is instant.

- Wide, open expressions
- Close proximity to others (no personal space concept)

**Vocal Approach:**

## 10. The Budding Villain With a Soft Spot

You're COMMITTED to the villain role. The costume, the laugh, the monologue—you've practiced in the mirror. But you're not actually evil. You're a kid who's chosen "villain" as an identity, and that choice is covering something real.

**Physical Life:**
- Theatrical poses and gestures
- Practiced villain stances (cape flip energy)
- Genuine surprise when vulnerability shows
- Physical recoil when caught being kind

**Vocal Approach:**
- Dramatic delivery, villain voice
- Evil laugh that you've definitely rehearsed

3. **Make the soft spot specific.** One person, one thing, one memory that breaks through.

### Related Archetypes

### How to Play It

**Push back, resist, break rules—but protect the vulnerable.**

You don't do what you're told. You roll your eyes at authority. You've probably been called "difficult" your whole life. But catch someone picking on the little kid, threaten someone you love, and suddenly that rebellion has a *target*.

- Softening that surprises even the character

**Vocal Approach:**
- Sarcastic, challenging tone with authority

- Reluctant admissions of caring
- Voice cracks on real emotion

### Audition Tactics

1. **Know who you're protecting.** Even if they're not in the scene, play *for* them.
2. **Make the defiance justified.** Rebellion should have roots—not just attitude.
3. **Let the heart show reluctantly.** Fighting your own softness is the key.

- Molly (*Molly's Game*, implied young) — High-achievement coping

### How to Play It

**Competence covering longing. Adult functioning, child needs.**

You handle things. You manage crises. Adults rely on you. But underneath is a kid who still needs what kids need—safety, play, being taken care of. That need rarely gets met.

**Physical Life:**
- Adult-like efficiency in movement
- Caretaking gestures (for siblings, home)
- Rare moments of letting guard down
- Physical markers of missed childhood

**Vocal Approach:**
- Mature vocabulary and delivery
- Practical, problem-solving tone
- Voice changes in rare safe moments
- Suppressed emotion breaking through

### Audition Tactics

1. **Know what they're carrying.** Play the weight of responsibility.

**Age Range:** 8-18

**Common Genres:** Comedy, Family Film, Teen Drama, Coming-of-Age, Fish-Out-of-Water

- Veruca Salt (*Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*) — Golden goose demands

### How to Play It

**Genuine belief in deserving, not mustache-twirling villainy.**

You're not *trying* to be a jerk—you genuinely believe this is how the world works. When your privilege doesn't work, you're genuinely confused. The arc is discovering that everyone matters.

**Physical Life:**
- Entitled posture (taking up space, expecting service)
- Genuine confusion when things don't go your way
- Physical discomfort with humble experiences
- Softening as arc progresses

**Vocal Approach:**
- Statements as demands
- "Do you know who I am?" energy
- Genuine frustration at being treated normally
- Softening in arc moments

### Audition Tactics

1. **Play entitled, not evil.** Belief in privilege is more interesting than cruelty.
2. **Find the humanity.** Why are they this way? What's the isolation underneath?
3. **Signal arc potential.** Even in early-arc scenes, let us see capacity for growth.

### How to Play It

**Active listening, genuine reactions, stealing your moments without overshadowing.**

You're not the lead—and that's fine. Your job is to make the scene work, react genuinely, and occasionally have your moment to shine. The supporting work is just as important as the lead work.

**Physical Life:**
- Responsive, present physicality
- Genuine reactions to lead's moments
- Own physical business in background
- Taking stage when it's your line

**Vocal Approach:**
- Reactive sounds and responses
- Genuine curiosity about lead's stories
- Clear, committed in your lines
- Not stepping on lead's moments

### Audition Tactics

1. **Bring genuine character.** Even in small roles, have a full person.
2. **Listen actively.** Your reactions are part of the scene.
3. **Don't disappear.** Supportive doesn't mean invisible—be alive in the scene.

### How to Play It

**Conviction without preachiness. Belief that can be tested.**

You believe deeply in right and wrong. You'll stand up even when it's hard. But you're also learning that change is complicated, that good people disagree, and that passion alone isn't enough.

**Physical Life:**
- Forward, engaged posture
- Marching, protesting physicality
- Standing ground when challenged
- Processing complexity in body

**Vocal Approach:**
- Clear, convicted delivery
- Finding words for big ideas

### How to Play It

**Observation mode meeting hope meeting fear.**

You're watching, learning the rules, figuring out who's safe and who's not. You carry whatever you're leaving behind. Every choice is high-stakes because you don't have established status.

**Physical Life:**
- Hesitant entry into spaces
- Observation before action
- Attempting to mirror local behavior
- Finding comfort (or not) as time passes

**Vocal Approach:**
- Careful word choice (don't say the wrong thing)

- Mia (*Princess Diaries*) — Hiding from princess identity
- Violet (*The Incredibles*) — Powers hidden under hair

### How to Play It

**The hiding must cost something. The reveal must feel risky.**

You're actively suppressing something real. Every time you hide it, there's a small death. When it finally comes out—on purpose or by accident—it's vulnerable exposure.

**Physical Life:**
- Caught moments when skill slips out
- Physical covering/suppressing
- Private moments of practicing/enjoying
- Full-body release when finally free

**Vocal Approach:**
- Deflecting when talent is suspected
- Lying or minimizing
- Voice change when talent is accessed
- Relief/terror in reveal

### Audition Tactics

2. **Play the slip-out moments.** When the talent accidentally shows.
3. **Make the reveal land.** This is your character's key transformation.

- Luisa (*Encanto*) — Carrying the family literally
- Carl (*Shameless*) — Protecting younger siblings

### How to Play It

**Vigilance + tenderness. Fierce outside, soft with your person.**

You're always scanning for threats. With the rest of the world, you're strong, tough, maybe even closed off. With your sibling? Soft. Gentle. They see a different you.

**Physical Life:**
- Standing between threat and sibling
- Gentle touch with sibling
- Tense readiness when sibling is at risk
- Physical comfort and caretaking

**Vocal Approach:**
- Sharp, protective with outsiders
- Soft, patient with sibling
- Managing sibling's fear
- Contained fear of your own

### Audition Tactics

1. **Find your specific sibling relationship.** This protection is personal.
2. **Play the cost.** Being the protector takes something from you.
3. **Show both faces.** The tough exterior and the tender interior.

## 36. The Class Clown With Anxiety

**Also Known As:** The Mask of Humor, The Deflecting Comedian, The "Can't Let Them See"

**Age Range:** 10-18

**Common Genres:** Comedy-Drama, Coming-of-Age, YA Adaptation, Dramedy

**Emotional Range:** Performing Funny → Frantic Escalation → Mask Slipping → Real Moment

**Kid/Tween References:**
- Jason (*The Good Place*, kid energy) — Comedy as protection
- Sokka, vulnerable moments (*Avatar*) — Jokes hiding real feelings
- Dewey, serious moments (*Malcolm in the Middle*) — What's underneath

### How to Play It

**The humor is real. The anxiety underneath is also real. Both at once.**

You're genuinely funny—that's not fake. But you can't stop being funny because the silence is too dangerous. What would happen if people really saw you?

**Physical Life:**
- Constant motion, bit commitment
- Energy escalation when threatened
- Physical stillness = terror
- Exhaustion when alone

**Vocal Approach:**
- Rapid-fire comedy delivery
- Filling every silence
- Voice change when caught vulnerable
- Quieter, realer voice in private

### Audition Tactics

1. **Play funny *and* anxious.** The comedy isn't separate from the fear.
2. **Find the moment it slips.** When does the mask crack?
3. **Don't judge the character.** This is survival, not shallowness.

## 37. The Gifted Athlete Under Pressure

**Common Genres:** Sports Drama, Coming-of-Age, Family Drama, Underdog Stories

**Emotional Range:** Focused Confidence → Performance Pressure → Fear of Failure → Victory or Processing Defeat

### Comparables to Study

- Rocky — Underdog pressure

**Kid/Tween References:**
- Webby (*DuckTales*) — Skill under pressure
- Any sports movie young lead — The championship moment
- Teen Olympics narratives — Young bodies, adult pressure

### How to Play It

**Physical confidence + mental pressure. Your body knows; your mind doubts.**

You've trained for this. Your body can do it. But everyone's watching, everything rides on this, and the voice in your head won't shut up about what happens if you fail.

**Physical Life:**
- Athletic, capable movement
- Pre-performance rituals
- Physical manifestation of pressure (tight shoulders, shallow breath)
- Victory/defeat in full body

**Vocal Approach:**
- Confident game-talk
- Internal pressure thoughts (if voiced)
- Managing expectations from others
- Processing results (either way)

### Audition Tactics

1. **Know the sport.** Research enough to play the physicality authentically.
2. **Play the mental game.** What's the internal monologue during performance?
3. **Find the stakes.** What does winning or losing mean beyond the game?

### Related Archetypes
→ The Eager Apprentice (similar drive, less pressure-focused)  
→ The Talented Kid Hiding It (opposite approach to talent)

## 38. The Bully With Reasons

**Also Known As:** The Complicated Antagonist, The "Why They're Mean", The Redeemable Bad Kid

**Core Trait:** The bully with backstory. Mean behavior has roots—home life, insecurity, learned behavior, survival. Not justified, but understood.

**Age Range:** 8-18

- Sid (*Toy Story*) — Disturbed, not evil
- Flash Thompson (various) — Classic bully, sometimes gets depth

### How to Play It

**The cruelty is real. The reason is also real. Don't apologize for either.**

You're actually being mean—don't soften it. But play the why. We should see hints of the broken thing underneath without excusing the behavior.

**Physical Life:**
- Aggressive, space-taking posture
- Intimidation moves
- Flinching or guarding in private moments
- Physical mimicry of power figures (often abusers)

**Vocal Approach:**
- Cruel, cutting delivery
- Voice patterns learned from home
- Different voice when guard is down
- Real pain when truth surfaces

### Audition Tactics

1. **Don't play sympathetic.** Play the bully truly, let the writing provide context.
2. **Find the source.** Where did this behavior come from?
3. **Signal arc potential.** Even unredeemed bullies should feel human.

## 39. The Sibling Rival

### How to Play It

**Competition doesn't cancel love. Play both.**

You might resent them. You might feel overlooked. You might be constantly compared. But when someone outside the family threatens your sibling? It's complicated, but they're still *yours*.

**Physical Life:**
- Competitive posturing with sibling
- Different presentation with/without sibling
- Physical loyalty when sibling is threatened
- Complex affection in quiet moments

**Vocal Approach:**
- Competitive digs and comparison
- "Mom/Dad always liked you" energy
- Defending sibling to outsiders
- Real conversation in private moments

### Audition Tactics

## 40. The Imagination-Dominant Kid

**Also Known As:** The Pretender, The Living-in-Fantasy, The "Is This Real?" Kid

**Emotional Range:** Immersed in Fantasy → Collision with Reality → Processing → Integration or Continued Escape

### How to Play It

**The imaginary world is real to you. Play it with full reality.**

Don't "pretend to pretend." When you're in the fantasy, BE there. The drama is in how reality intrudes, how the fantasy world serves emotional needs, and how imagination intersects with real problems.

**Physical Life:**
- Full physical commitment to fantasy scenarios
- Transitions between "worlds"
- Physical stillness when reality pulls you back
- Joy and freedom in imagination

**Vocal Approach:**
- Different voice in fantasy world
- Narration of internal stories
- Confusion or resistance when pulled to reality
