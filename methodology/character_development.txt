#What does the writer say about your character?
In a character breakdown, sometimes you’ll get nothing more than the character’s
name. Sometimes, you’ll get their age, occupation and even the details of their
relationship to other characters in the story. Write all that down! The character bio that a
screenwriter might give you can vary wildly, from the most in depth-description of a
character you’ve ever seen, to something like this:
SALLY. Works at the mechanics, has known SIMON for three years. Suspicious. 26.
Or even this:
WOMAN–any age.
In terms of characterisation, the amount of detail the writer gives you reveals how much
creative license you have to use. It shows you whether you have to turn a square, a
dodecahedron or a singular line into a three-dimensional, living, breathing human. If you
are given that singular line of ‘WOMAN–any age‘, I feel the writer is saying to me: “Go
for it, I have no idea who she is yet.” What a gift!
#What does your character say about themselves?
Get your face back in that script and go through it with a ne-tooth comb. If your
character says anything about themselves, then get your notebook out and write it all
down—no matter how big or how small it may seem.
What do these things reveal to you about your character’s self-awareness? Are they a
good judge of their own character? Are they modest about their capabilities? And if so,
why? Are they being truthful about themselves or are they lying? If they are lying, why
are they lying? What’s at stake for them? Isolating these things and asking these
questions will bring you closer and closer to understanding how your character
perceives themselves. Most importantly, you’ll begin to notice the difference in how they
present in public to others and privately to themselves.
As an extension to this: think about how your character speaks—about themselves or
others. Do they speak with con dence? Do they ll a page with dialogue? Maybe they
don’t say much at all. Why not? Do they use a ten-dollar phrase when a ve-buck word
would do? What’s their level of education? Writers often give us all sorts of hints about
characters hidden in plain sight as dialogue. Remember that every single word has
been agonised over: work to discover the reason behind each individual choice.

#What do other characters say about your character?
This one’s similar to the previous exercise, but now you’re only looking for what other
characters say about yours. Once again, question and deduce whether these things are
accurate or not. Are they observations or judgements? Are they telling a story from your
character’s past? Is your character present or not present when these things are said?
Do these things ultimately help your character or not? I like to think of it as though
you’re a lawyer representing your character in court and you’re combing through the
evidence you’ve been presented. Advocate for them—defend them: even if they’re a
monster! Especially if they’re a monster.
The power you gain from these discoveries gives you the ability to decide whether to
actively play into, or not play into what’s being said about your character. Or do a blend
of both. You can test out things in rehearsal to see what it does to the dynamic amongst
the other characters, how it adds friction and how it can roughen up the edges of the
characters relationships a little bit.

#What don’t you have in common with your character?
This is the key to understanding them through Empathy so you can feel what they feel.
Whether or not there’s a big leap between the character’s life experience and my own, I
write down a list of everything myself and my character don’t have in common. These
can be as simple as:
I didn’t grow up in an urban environment like my character.
My character grew up in a family of 7 people, whereas I grew up in a house of 4.
We have different accents.
We were born on and live in different continents.
I am not an assassin, whereas my character is.
Or as complex as:
My character knows how to give someone rst aid in a crisis, I don’t currently have
those skills.
My character has had a near-death experience which affected the trajectory of their life,
whereas I have not.
#What do you and your character have in common?
This your entry point to finding an entry way into becoming them. Your commonalities.
Once you’ve nished that list, get out your notebook and write down every single thing
that you and your character do have in common. Once again, it doesn’t matter how
obvious or obscure they may be. Every time I do this, it completely surprises me to
discover how many things myself and my character have in common. It often helps me
understand and connect with the character on a human level. Think of this as building a
bridge between yourself and your character—even if it looks like there’s an enormous
space between yourself and them. Here are a few examples of the kinds of things I
might take note of:
We are both women.
We were both born in the same era.
We both have siblings.
My character mentions that she like zucchini, I also like zucchini.
My character says she is not afraid to talk about death. I also feel this way.
My character talks a lot about her cousins, I also do the same.
We both received an education.

#What do you respect or admire about your character?
Even if your character is a tyrannical dictator who kills everyone, I nd that writing a list
of things I (at the very least) respect, or (at the very most) admire about the character
helps me nd some sort of empathy for them as a person. Even if you consider their
actions immoral or unjust, you still have to be your character’s biggest advocate in the
rehearsal space—and, eventually, in the story itself. It’s our job as actors to understand
why people are what they are and do what they do.
Let’s go with the tyrannical dictator example. The task here is not to try and condone
your character’s actions, exerting a moral high-ground over them or excusing them for
any beliefs they may have. But rather: to strive for nding a place of impartiality or
neutrality to play the character from. Or at least as much as you possibly can. Playing
from a place of emotional judgement can result in instructing the audience to feel about
them that same way you do. If you play the character with all their faults as they’re
written, free of your own personal judgement, the audience will respect that.

This task can always help you to pinpoint why the character behaves a certain way, has
a certain world view, a perception of other people or of life in general that is unique to
them. What have they endured, witnessed, battled or been taught/subjected to that has
made them who they are? Do you respect these things or consider certain attributes
they’ve developed admirable? There’s always a reason, and I’m always up for nding
that reason, no matter how dark, macabre or insidious the character’s actions and
worldview may be.
#What is your character’s relationship to every other character in the script?
Depending on the script, I prefer to start simple and build on it as I go: “This is him, this
is her, she likes him, he likes someone else, that’s her uncle, he’s so-and-so’s
brother…” Just so I can keep tabs on the various character relationships. From there, I
simply keep adding and writing down details as I discover them.
But you can go absolutely nuts with this one if you like. Draw a family tree, do a graph,
make a Venn diagram, create a series of dating pro les. The sky’s the limit, here.
Whatever it is you need to help you see the overall picture and where your character ts
in relationship-wise, go for it.

#What is your character’s relationship to the world, the universe and beyond?
This is the backstory and building out a fully edged human being with beliefs and
experiences.
These are a slightly more in-depth list of character questions. If you like, you can go
back over the lists you’ve already made about how you and your character relate to
each other for reference. Ask yourself:
What are their politics?
Are they hopeful or pessimistic about themselves and their future?
Are they an existential thinker?
What are their beliefs?
How do they respond to their beliefs, politics, spirituality or world view being
questioned or debated?
Do they have any obvious or specific spirituality?
Do they believe in another dimension running alongside their own?
Do they believe in a spirit world?
Do they believe in a higher power?
Do they think laterally or literally?
What’s their relationship to authority?
Are they a sceptic?
Are they a conspiracy theorist?
If it’s not specified, would they buy into conspiracy theories or not?
Do any of these things change for your character throughout the story? And how do
these attributes then inform your character’s motivations and inner drive as the story
develops? Some more things to question are:
Have they always been told predominantly yes or no throughout their lives?

How many major obstacles have they faced in their life thus far?
Consider how these things might affect their reaction to achieving or not achieving their
objective throughout a scene. What is their sense of expectation looking like, and how
hard have they had to ght for what they needed in the past? Has it made them develop
tactical or strategic thinking? Knowing these things helps me make decisions about my
character that I can experiment, subvert and muck around with in the rehearsal room.

#What is your character’s voice?
Get speci c, get local, get regional! The more speci c you can get and the earlier you
can start, the better. It’s a lot harder to layer on a brand new accent or a vocal
affectation in the late stages of your rehearsal process than it is working it into your
scene work from day one. This can ensure you have time to properly embody the
character’s voice, so the work is done and you won’t have to actively think about it.
There are so many secrets about a character that can reveal themselves through an
accent or voice, not just geographical origins. If you have access to this sort of
information about your character, consider how the way they speak can be in uenced
by:
Their parents’ heritage.
Whether they grew up speaking more than one language.
If they grew up around hills, canyons or concrete unit blocks.
Whether they grew up in the endlessly repetitive mazes of suburbia, or with wide open
spaces and endless plains of wheat stretching out before their eyes.
Whether they’ve lived in multiple geographical locations and set-ups.
Whether they were always told children should be seen and not heard, or they were
given licence to let their presence be known vocally any time they pleased.
Whether they grew up amongst nature, the ground beneath them irregular and uneven
—where sound seems to reverberate out and then disappear into the void ahead—or
the hard blunt surfaces of a concrete jungle, where the sound of a million beeping cars
bounces and echoes into a cacophony around them.
Your character, just like you, has a uniquely speci c sound to compete with or in
response to their immediate surroundings, their heritage, their social conditioning. It
forms their vocal patterns, habits, cadence and then level of freedom they feel to
express themselves vocally.
Also, consider your character’s opinion of how they sound:
Does your character slightly alter or feel a need to formalize their accent in social and
professional settings?
Do they need to differentiate themselves vocally amongst other characters in the
play/ lm?
Are they embarrassed by, proud of or neutral about their accent?
The discoveries you make and choices you cement from specifying your character’s
way of speaking don’t need to be commented on or pressed onto your audience. This
sort of investigative work and consideration is all there to add nuance and another layer
to add to the acting work you do on the oor. A different accent won’t be relevant to
every character you play, but when you do get that opportunity, curiously pursue the
depths of how much voice can de ne a human as they move through the world, strive
for what they need and forge an identity.

#Your character’s walk.
This one’s notorious for a reason. Layering on a stylised walk purely for the sake of
being different or to draw the audience’s attention never ends well. Most of the time,
people will immediately say ‘Why’s Steve walking like that?’, rather than taking in the
story. Stay curiously creative, be respectful and have fun physically exploring how your
character moves through the world and why.
Some things to consider:
Where is their centre of gravity?
From which body part do they lead when they walk?
How does it differ to yours?
How does this shift influence their inner world, or not?
Is the story in a stylised world?
In what environment do we see your character?
Does it affect how urgently your character needs to move from one place to the
other?
What’s their occupation, if any, and does it influence the way they move?
Is their walk affected by their age?
Is their walk affected by past injuries?
You don’t have to go big and bold to convey anything to your audience. You’ll nd that
something as simple as a subtle shift of your centre of gravity can affect your gait
dramatically. Do some homework on it before a rehearsal, muck around with it at home
with some big bold offers, distil it down and see what could work and what will help you.
I always underestimate the power of just knowing where my character’s centre of gravity
is, and how their inner motor differs to mine. The knowledge, alone, can drastically
affect a scene.
#Your character and gesture.
Never underestimate the power of gesture. Again, know exactly how stylised the project
is on the scale of naturalism right up to avant-garde absurdism. Does your character
have a repetitive or habitual action? Or a nervous tic that they are always trying to hide
from those around them? How are they publicly-private on stage, or in front of the
camera? Do they stand suspiciously still or have a hectic energy when under pressure?
Do they have a tell? You have the power to decide how good their poker face is, and
when they reveal what’s churning on the inside. What a cool thing.
#Think about their relationship to props
What does your character hold in their hands and how does that inform their gesture?
Are they someone who always holds and icks a lighter, or always has a pen in their
hand and uses it to punctuate things in the air as they say them?

#Write your character’s inner monologue.
Think and process as your character in real time. Become them.
It’s rare to receive a character who only ever means what they say, and says what they
mean without a contrasting inner-monologue, drive, or agenda.
Exactly how much your inner monologue in uences your character development is up to
you, but know that it can be signi cant. It allows you to take everything you know about
your character’s past/present/future wants/needs/desires and boil it down into a rich,
inner life. It informs your character’s actions, and then is either af rmed or challenged
by what then happens next in the scene. And it keeps shifting and changing in response
to the outside world.

to the outside world.
Creating a solid inner monologue for your character is an awesome thing. It ensures the
ever-present running commentary going on in their own inner world, keeping them
engaged in pursuing their objective—both super- and in the present moment.
#Write a character backstory.
This is, hands down, my favourite step. I will take every liberty in creating the longest,
most convoluted backstories you could possibly imagine. And nobody can stop me.
Nobody! Whatever the writer hasn’t already given me about the character’s past, I will
happily ll in on my own. Get all ‘Who Do you Think You Are?’ and ‘This is Your Life’ on
that creativity
Decide everything about the character that gives the story meaning for you and gives
you a whole person to play with. Write it all down! Or, better yet, get a friend to do a
‘hot-seat’ interview with you and improvise it. Decide where they were born, who their
parents are, who their second cousin is. While you’re at it, decide why they stabbed
someone in a K-Mart car park in 2012 and what that has to do with their purchase of a
boat on page thirty-seven. No one has to know this backstory except you.
Write down every single hilarious and traumatic thing that has ever happened to them in
their life, small things that they’ve done that no one else knows, the secrets they hold,
the good and bad deeds they’ve done, the moments that shaped them and the
moments that didn’t. Backstory not only lls in the blanks for you, but gives you a
stronger connection to who this character is at the time you’re portraying them. For me,
it makes the whole process one hundred times more fun.
#Diary entries.
If backstory isn’t your thing—or the writer has given you an in-depth backstory already—
then diary entries may be a more helpful tool. The diary entry is a more personal,
private admission of the innermost thoughts and feelings of your character’s experience,
day-to-day.
You could write diary entries for your character’s days before, during or even after the
events of the story—that last one’s if you want go hardcore with this exercise. Writing
diary entries really helps me differentiate between my character’s social and private
identities. It can help you nd if there’s a signi cant tonal shift between the two. If so,
take note of what it sounds and feels like.
Embracing Character Behaviors
An essential aspect of getting into character is embracing their unique behaviors and
traits. By studying how your character behaves, their mannerisms, speech patterns, and
body language, you can accurately portray their personality and create a deeper
connection with your audience. Self-awareness plays a crucial role in embracing
character behaviors. By understanding your own personality traits and those of your
character, you can develop a better portrayal and create a more genuine performance.

# Archetypes.
AKA Types—classic, ‘stock’ representations of character types—have a great power to
steer you in the right direction if you feel like you’ve gone too far off course. Locking
down choices, or even knowing where to start building your character from, can feel
really challenging at times, particularly if you’re not given a whole lot to work with in the
text. I nd that understanding which archetype my character is helps me to understand
their dynamic with the other characters in the scene/play/ lm/story, and offers start to
ow from there.
Is your character:
The know it all
The Popular One
The Wise One
The Weirdo
The Boy Crazy/Girl Crazy one
The Class Clown
The Sarcastic Quiet One
The Baby
The Drama Queen
The Athlete/Jock
The Dumb One
The Anarchist/Gothic Rebel
The Neurotic Nervous Worrier
The Leader, Bossy Type
The Loner, Nerd, Geek, science type
And the types and tropes go on and on
Or perhaps a blend of two or more? Realistically, everyone is a complex blend of
archetypes all the time.
What options can that open for you? How does that help develop an understanding of a
character’s powers and limitations in the scene/play/their whole life?
TV series and lms such as Friends, The Nanny, Seinfeld, Game of Thrones, Saving
Private Ryan, Ocean’s 11 and Killing Eve are great examples of archetype work. In
theatre, the examples are almost too numerous: The Comedy of Errors, Romeo and
Juliet, Julius Caesar, Medea, Antigone, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The View from the
Bridge, The Blue Room. It’s always a thrill and a joy to watch the actors establish their
archetype, utilise it and subvert it.

fl

You can do all of the above work—backstory, diarising, inner-monologuing, physical
exploration, objectives, motivations—and still feel like you’re at square f**king one.
Then, you put your character’s shoes on for the rst time and you go:
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, here she is.”
It can simply be where the pockets are placed on your character’s jacket that make you
hold your arms differently. Or how you have to pull you shoulders so far back that your
shoulder blades are almost pinching together; or the tight, restrictive lines of poorlytailored professional wear informing how trapped your character feels in their own life.
How much does the weight of the crown on your head feel like the weight of
responsibility over an entire nation of people: does it make you push your chest out?
Curl your shoulders forward? And does this shift throughout the story?
Sometimes, the clothes can do half the work for you. I wouldn’t suggest depending
entirely on your character’s costume pieces to inform all of who they are, but it can
sometimes be the missing piece of the puzzle—something that helps make your
character feel lived in and allows an outside impetus to add to what’s going on inside.
There’s a lot of inside-out work that needs doing, but don’t underestimate the power of
the outside-in.

#Character References
Sometimes types help. But using a reference for a person or a character that you know
well can be the magic key to understanding them fully. To know how they would
approach and behave in any given moment. This is gold and a huge shortcut to guring
it all out. Use real people, family, friends. TV or Film characters. Book Characters.

#Developing Your Character’s Physicality from Head to Toe
Physicality, along with your voice and imagination, helps you to tell a story. As an actor,
it is important to develop your character’s physicality so that it is different from your own.
The drama classroom is a great place for students to explore different physical
attributes that they can use to make characters unique and real. These attributes can
also be utilized during the rehearsal process of a show.
Going head to toe is useful for developing a character’s physicality; that way, every
body part is addressed and none of them are skipped over.
Head, Face, & Neck
Your face is one of the rst things someone else will notice when they see or meet you.
Think about how your character’s face shows emotions/feelings. Does the character
show their emotions clearly on their face or do they mask their feelings (i.e. have a
“poker face”)?
Does the character look others in the eye, or do they look away, down, or in another
direction? Why? (This is a good indicator of your character’s con dence level, or else if
they’re lying or distracted.)
Does the character have a signature facial expression, or “resting face”? Do they tend
to smile, sneer, grimace?
Does the character have a physical ailment on their face or head (for example:
blindness, deafness, missing teeth, stiff neck)? These will affect how the character
moves his/her head and face.
Upper Body (shoulders, arms, hands, chest, abdomen)
Does the character have good posture? Do they stand up straight or slouch?
Does the character swing their arms when they walk, or hold them tightly at their sides?
Do they cross their arms, hug themselves, or wring their hands?
How big are the character’s gestures? Do they use their hands while they speak?
Do they touch other characters? Which ones? How do they touch them?
Does the character breathe deeply or take shallow breaths? Is breathing easy or
dif cult?
Lower Body (lower back, hips, pelvis, legs, feet)
Does the character move slowly or quickly? Why? Do they limp or stumble?
Is the character light on their feet or do they plod and stomp along? Do they lift their feet
when they walk?
Do the character’s feet turn inwards or outwards when they walk? Do they walk heelrst or toe- rst?

archetype, utilise it and subvert it.

Additional Physicality Thoughts
How old is your character? (A twelve year old, a fty year old, and an eighty year old will
all move differently.)
How physically t is your character? Are they strong or weak? Have they ever been an
athlete?
What past or present physical challenges/ailments has your character had, if any?
Injuries? Sickness?
These questions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to thinking about a
character’s physicality. Students may come up with many more thoughts and questions
while exploring their characters. Once students have a clear plan for how their
characters physically express themselves try it out, and explore!
Exploring Physical and Emotional Traits
Characters have unique physical and emotional traits that in uence their behavior and
mannerisms. Analyze your character's physicality, gestures, expressions, and emotional
states throughout the script. By embodying these traits, you can create a compelling
and nuanced performance.
Voice and Speech Analysis
Analyze your character's vocal characteristics, such as accent, tone, pitch, and speech
patterns. Understand how these aspects contribute to their personality and background.
By re ning your voice and speech to match the character, you can enhance the
believability of your performance.
Physicality and Movement
Characters express themselves through their physicality and movement. Analyze your
character's posture, gait, gestures, and facial expressions. Explore how these physical
elements re ect their emotional state and personality. By incorporating appropriate
physicality, you can bring your character to life visually.
Posture, Gestures, and Expressions
Pay attention to your character's posture, gestures, and facial expressions in different
situations. Analyze how these physical choices align with their emotional state,
intentions, and relationships with other characters. Fine-tuning these details will add
depth and authenticity to your performance.
Breaking Down the Characters
Studying the Character's Background and Motivations
To portray a character convincingly, it's essential to understand their background,
experiences, and motivations. Dive into their history, personality traits, and any
signi cant events that shaped them. This knowledge will inform your choices and help
you embody the character more authentically.

Exploring Relationships and Dynamics
Characters don't exist in isolation; they are shaped by their relationships with others.
Analyze the dynamics between your character and other signi cant characters in the
script. Consider the nature of these relationships, the power dynamics, and any con icts
or tensions that arise. Understanding the character's interactions will inform your
choices during scenes.

character's arc, observing how they evolve emotionally, psychologically, or physically.
Look for key moments or turning points that contribute to their development.
Understanding the character's journey will help you navigate their emotional state and
growth.
Decoding Character Motivation
Character motivation drives the actions and decisions of the characters. Dive deep into
your character's psyche to understand their desires, fears, and goals. By decoding their
motivation, you can create a three-dimensional character that resonates with the
audience.
Identifying Character Arcs
Characters often undergo transformations and growth throughout the script. Analyze
your character's arc, from their initial state to their nal transformation. Understanding
the evolution of your character will enable you to portray their journey convincingly.
Character Analysis: Discovering Your Role
Character analysis is a crucial aspect of script analysis. Dive into the complexities of
your character by examining their backstory, motivations, desires, and con icts. By
understanding your character's journey, you can develop a profound connection and
bring authenticity to your performance.

Building a Character's History
To create a fully realized character, delve into their backstory. Develop details about
their upbringing, experiences, relationships, and signi cant events that shape who they
are. By constructing a comprehensive backstory, you can bring depth and authenticity to
your portrayal.
