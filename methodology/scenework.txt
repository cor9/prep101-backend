Uta Hagen's nine questions helps you be present in a scene by understanding the key facts that exist in each moment. 

Who am I? (Character description, personality, behavior, backstory)
Where am I? (Often found in scene slug, location of this scene)
What time is it? (Time of day gives us insight in to what behavior we might have)
What surrounds me? (Use imagination to create the scene, environment with details. You want to defictionalize the fiction) 
What are the circumstances? (What events have happened to my character that has led to this moment)
What are my relationships? (Who am I talking to?, How do I feel about them?, Whats my relationship or history with this location?, How do I feel about it?)
What do I want? (What is the goal you are trying to achieve in this moment?, What do you want another character to do or feel?)
What is my obstacle? (Define the conflict in the scene, what is stopping you from reaching your goal?)
What do I do to get what I want? (What behaviors or actions will you use to get what you want?)

Scene breakdown is essential: Actors need to understand the scene's theme and what is happening in the scene. This helps the actor to contextualize their reactions, emotions, and body language. Actors should ask themselves what type of scene they are in, what the other actor is saying, and how they should react based on their character's traits and motivations.

#The Moment Before
The “moment before” is a technical acting term that refers to what’s happening in the life of the character right before an actor walks out on stage or a director yells “action” in TV and film.
It is one of the parts of an actor’s toolbox that helps the actor explore the inner life of the character, by asking themselves what happened right before the scene starts.
As an exercise, actors can imagine what’s happened sixty seconds before the start of the scene, thirty seconds, ten seconds, and finally one second before. The reason for this is because the "moment before” is a critical part of the process for actors to perform the scene.
It contains events, emotions, thoughts, images, relationships, conflicts, physical conditions, objectives, and other mental and emotional information which the character is going through before the director yells “action.”
Actors can utilize the “moment before” by giving themselves a place to come from, both physically and emotionally. Create a “moment before” that has a different energy than the scene, it helps add Urgency and Raises the Stakes.
For example, you may be thinking about finally asking the girl you like out on a date. You spent the day mustering up the courage, going out to the mall to get expensive clothes, if you start the scene on an emotional high, you have more places to go when you’re confronted with the girl of your dreams telling you she’s interested in the school bully instead.
Lastly, the “moment before” is one of the only times, the energy of the scene can be directed inwards to the actor. It’s a “me” moment and the surprise of someone else entering our world catapults the energy of the scene into the classic dialogue and back and forth we’re all used to seeing. 

The Button
Most actors are familiar with the “moment before” but what is often forgotten is the moment after or “the button.”
Your character had a life before the scene and will continue to have a life after the scene is done and that’s where “the button” comes in.
Often times actors are unsure how to end the scene and in most cases the last piece of text or beat is fine, however in certain circumstances using a “button” is a great way to show the full emotional range of a character.
Imagine an actor is fighting with their spouse in the scene over who ate the last muffin. At the end of the scene, the couple makes up but as a “button” the actress auditioning breaks into tears of frustration or tries to lighten the mood and make her spouse laugh with a funny face or “It wasn’t that good, don’t worry.”
The “button” tells casting directors that you are an advanced actor that understands where the story is heading.
“Buttons” come up a lot in commercial auditions, where the final moment is a reaction or the CD wants you to continue the action you began with.
Like the “moment before” an actors “button” is also a rare moment of “me” time and the actor can bring the attention inwards again.


In the realm of acting, the significance of silence is frequently disregarded. Numerous actors prioritize their spoken lines, conveyed emotions, and physical gestures. Nevertheless, the potential of silence should not be underestimated. Skillfully employing moments of silence can elevate a performance, generate suspense, and mesmerize spectators.
The actor’s toolkit is enhanced by the potency of silence, as it allows for the expression of emotions and thoughts without depending on spoken language. By utilizing physicality, facial cues, and delicate movements, the actor can communicate a wealth of information. When employed skillfully, silence has the ability to convey a multitude of emotions and establish a profound bond with the audience.
One of the fundamental aspects of utilizing silence is active listening. By listening attentively to their scene partners, actors can respond in a genuine and natural manner. This active listening involves not just hearing the words spoken but also understanding the subtext and the emotional undercurrents beneath the dialogue. It requires the actor to be fully present in the moment and to react authentically to their surroundings.
The power of silence is particularly evident in moments of heightened tension or conflict. When a character is faced with a significant choice or a crucial turning point, silence can amplify the stakes and create a sense of anticipation. By withholding words, the actor invites the audience to project their own interpretations onto the scene, generating a level of engagement and emotional investment that would be difficult to achieve with dialogue alone.
The absence of words can also serve as a potent means of expressing intricate emotions. During times of sorrow, bereavement, or self-reflection, silence can be more impactful than any lengthy speech. By letting feelings simmer beneath the surface, an actor has the capacity to convey a profound inner turmoil or vulnerability that deeply resonates with the audience. The actor’s skill lies in their aptitude for communication beyond mere words.
During times of sorrow, bereavement, or self-reflection, the lack of words can carry a stronger impact than any speech. By permitting emotions to remain unspoken but deeply felt, an actor can convey a profound inner turmoil or fragility that deeply touches the audience. The actor’s capacity to communicate without depending solely on verbal expression holds the key to this power.
Silence can be used to create a sense of rhythm and pacing within a performance. Just as a composer uses rests and pauses in music to create tension and build anticipation, actors can use strategic moments of silence to guide the flow of a scene. By varying the tempo and intensity of the silence, an actor can control the emotional arc of their character and the overall narrative.
Another aspect of harnessing the power of silence is the effective use of stillness. In a world filled with constant movement and noise, stillness can be incredibly compelling. By deliberately slowing down and embracing stillness, an actor can command attention and draw focus to their presence. The contrast between motion and stillness can be a captivating theatrical device, highlighting the significance of a character’s actions or thoughts.
Actors need to develop a profound self-assurance and trust in both themselves and their colleagues. They should feel at ease with moments of silence and refrain from feeling compelled to fill them with unnecessary actions or sounds. This demands self-control and an openness to the unfamiliar, enabling the transformative influence of silence to take effect. This drives me nuts because I like to talk. Even right now, I have the desire to continue writing.
The power of silence can also have practical advantages for actors. It can help them develop a stronger stage presence, as well as improve their ability to engage with the audience and command attention. Moreover, by mastering the art of silence, actors can become more adept at communicating non-verbally, which can be invaluable in auditions and on-screen performances where dialogue may be limited.
By attentively listening, embracing tranquility, and having faith in nonverbal communication, actors can access the profound and subtle aspects that silence brings. Therefore, when you find yourself on stage or facing a camera, keep in mind the potency of silence and allow it to convey a multitude of emotions in your portrayal.
Below are some examples to draw from:
 is renowned for his adeptness at utilizing silence in his acting. Among his most memorable portrayals is that of Hannibal Lecter in “The Silence of the Lambs.” Throughout the movie, Hopkins’s character emanates an understated yet formidable energy, frequently communicating volumes through a mere glance or a faint grin rather than relying on dialogue. This controlled and restrained portrayal not only garnered him an Academy Award but also served as a striking demonstration of silence’s ability to construct a mesmerizing and disconcerting persona.

#Strasberg Method
Acting from memory is a technique from  or as he called it, “affective memory, summoning emotions from the actors’ own life to illuminate their stage roles.” In other words, Strassberg’s teachings instruct the actors to remember the details surrounding an emotional experience in their own life that could correspond to the emotion of a character in a scene. 

#Meisner Method

The foundation work begins with exercises like repetition, individual activities, and emotional preparation. At the beginning of the Meisner training, an actor is taught to work all from himself or herself. Answering the questions, “What are they doing, and how do I feel about it?” From the actor’s perspective. The thought being, how would you know how other characters would react if you don’t know how you would react first.

#Adler Method
Acting wholly from imagination is a technique from Stella Adler. Adler visited Stanislavski eight weeks before he died, at the end of his life, this is what he said, Strasberg misunderstood, Stanislavski did use emotional memory, but it did not work and was abandoned under the premise and under the philosophy: the sane mind must heal.
The Stella Adler technique is a series of exercises that start with the actors’ reality and ends entirely with their imagination, completely removed from their own experiences and feelings.
The first exercise of the Stella Adler Technique is the only exercise that exists in the actor’s reality. The actor must go out and see something in nature, come back to class, and describe it. The objective of this exercise is to translate an image be able to describe it in such length that I can see what the actor sees, then that actor can work out of their imagination.
In this technique, the actor’s imagination must be equal to the reality. Imagination and reality must be congruent. This is not easy, and it takes much rehearsal.

#Practical Aesthetics method 
The Practical Aesthetics method asks four questions to break down a scene:
The “Literal” — What is literally taking place in a scene
The “Want” — What does the character want to do or say in a given scene. This is their overall goal. 
The “Essential Action” — The most essential want of the character. Basically boiling down the “want” to an essential drive or human desire. 
The “As If” — Relating the questions above to the actor’s life, in a metaphorical sense, and not based on real experience or memory. If the essential action is “Revenge for my family,” the as ifcould be “As if the school bully beat up my younger brother. I need to find a way to get back at the bully and stand up for my brother.”
