comedy takes a special kind of fearlessness from an actor. It
takes total full body physicality, lots of energy and absolute
commitment. An awareness that the best laughs come from the
weirdest of ideas. And they securely know their own unique
brand of humor and how to use it to get a laugh.
Every time a performer makes somebody laugh
by doing some form of comedy, there is a
dopamine reward ring off making them feel
great. The mind begins creating a record of that
success to store away for future reference. Over
time the brain recognizes how and when you
are sucessful at being funny. And that becomes
your comedic strength. The brand of humor that
is your signature calling card. Once dialed in to
that you can not only lean into your unique
comedy style to land jokes, but you can think of
a lot more creative and absurd ways to
approach humor. The unexpected and absurd
usually gets the biggest laughs.

How to play comedy in a more realistic setting
Comedic pacing is the lifeline to the sitcom script.
Mastering pace is a vital acting skill, often lacking
in kids. Jokes are usually only successful in securing
a laugh when they are landed by actors with
attentive, rehearsed, and precise timing. Creating
too much space or slowing speech will almost
certainly kill a joke. Keep a rhythmic snappy tone
when rehearsing comedy. Self tapes that are out of
sync with the expected pace will negatively stand
out and the performance will suffer.
