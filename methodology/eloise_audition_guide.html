<h1>Eloise's Plaza Hotel Adventure<br>
<small>Audition Preparation Guide for Lead Role</small></h1>

<div class="intro-hook">
You're not just auditioning for a role. You're auditioning to BE the Plaza Hotel's most famous resident—a girl who can turn a hotel lobby into her personal kingdom with nothing but curiosity, charm, and an unstoppable spirit.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>

<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Feature Film - Classic Family Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Whimsical Family Comedy-Adventure (Think "Paddington" meets "Home Alone")</p>
<p><strong>Tone & Style:</strong> This isn't your typical kid's movie. It's sophisticated storytelling that respects children's intelligence while delivering pure joy. The tone is elegant mischief—Eloise is clever, not chaotic. Think wit over wackiness, charm over chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Comparable Projects:</strong> "Paddington," "Matilda," "The Grand Budapest Hotel" (but kid-friendly), classic Shirley Temple films</p>
<p><strong>Scene Context:</strong> This is Eloise's world being threatened for the first time. Her beloved Plaza—her entire universe—could change forever. We're watching a little girl realize that even the most magical places aren't immune to the adult world's complications.</p>

<div class="eloise-magic">
Remember: Eloise doesn't live AT the Plaza. She IS the Plaza. This threat isn't just about change—it's about her identity being erased.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN</h2>

<h3>Who is Eloise? (The Real Version)</h3>
<p>Eloise is a force of nature disguised as a little girl. She's not bratty—she's brilliant. Not spoiled—she's sophisticated. She sees herself as an equal to every adult in the hotel because, frankly, she's often smarter than they are. She's curious about everything, fearless in pursuit of answers, and absolutely convinced that she belongs wherever she decides to be.</p>

<h3>How She Sees Herself:</h3>
<p>The unofficial mayor of the Plaza Hotel. Eloise genuinely believes she's an integral part of the hotel's operations—and honestly? She kind of is. She's the Plaza's heart and soul, even if the adults don't always appreciate that fact.</p>

<h3>How Others See Her:</h3>
<p>Mr. Salomone sees her as a delightful menace who somehow always gets her way. The staff probably love her but also slightly fear her ability to turn any situation into an adventure. To adults, she's precocious and charming but exhausting.</p>

<h3>Your Bridge to Eloise (Find Your Connection):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever felt like you understood something important that adults were missing?</li>
<li>Do you have a special place that feels like "yours"?</li>
<li>Are you the type of kid who asks "Why?" until adults give up?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt protective of something or someone you love?</li>
<li>Do you believe rules are more like... suggestions?</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Empathy Stretch (What's Different About Her):</h3>
<ul>
<li>She lives in a world of luxury you might not understand</li>
<li>Her confidence is absolute—no self-doubt whatsoever</li>
<li>She's been the center of attention her entire life</li>
<li>She's never really been told "no" and meant it</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Character Shortcut:</strong> Eloise is what happens when unlimited curiosity meets unlimited confidence meets unlimited access. She's not spoiled—she's empowered. And that makes her absolutely magnetic.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3. UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (ELOISE EDITION)</h2>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm Eloise, the Plaza Hotel's most important resident (even if some adults forget that sometimes). I'm an expert in hotel operations, an adventurer, and the person who makes sure everything stays interesting around here. I know every secret passage, every staff member's name, and exactly which elevator button gets you to the roof fastest.</p>

<h3>Where am I?</h3>
<p>MY lobby. The Plaza Hotel lobby isn't just where I live—it's my kingdom. Every marble tile, every crystal chandelier, every velvet chair is part of my world. This place has rules, but I'm the exception to most of them.</p>

<h3>What time is it?</h3>
<p>It's a perfectly ordinary afternoon that's about to become perfectly extraordinary. It's the time of day when interesting things usually happen—which is why I'm here instead of wherever Nanny thinks I should be.</p>

<h3>What surrounds me?</h3>
<p>Pure elegance trying to contain pure chaos (me). The Plaza lobby is all gold and marble and crystal—very serious and adult. But I'm here now, so it's about to become much more fun. There are guests who think they're important, staff who pretend they don't love me, and Mr. Salomone who's about to tell me something VERY interesting.</p>

<h3>What are the relationships?</h3>
<p>Mr. Salomone is my favorite grown-up because he treats me like I'm smart (which I am). He also gives the best information when properly motivated. Levi is my newest friend and adventure partner—he gets it. These other people are just temporary visitors to MY hotel.</p>

<h3>What are the circumstances?</h3>
<p>Something is different today. I can feel it. Mr. Salomone is acting weird, and when adults act weird, it usually means something interesting is happening that they don't want to tell me about. Which means I absolutely must find out what it is.</p>

<h3>What do I want?</h3>
<p>ANSWERS. Why is today special? Who is this "new owner"? And most importantly—how do I make sure nobody changes MY Plaza? I want to understand this threat so I can figure out how to stop it.</p>

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
<p>Adults and their ridiculous need to "protect" me from information. Mr. Salomone's desire to avoid my questions. The fact that grown-ups think children can't handle important things (which is obviously wrong).</p>

<h3>How do I get what I want?</h3>
<p>By being absolutely impossible to ignore. If gentle questioning doesn't work, I'll escalate to mild threats (handstand walking across the lobby). If that doesn't work, I'll escalate to pure Eloise logic until he surrenders and tells me everything.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4. SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY</h2>

<h3>What Eloise is Actually DOING:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making an entrance:</strong> That cartwheel isn't showing off—it's claiming territory</li>
<li><strong>Reading the room:</strong> She immediately senses something's different and investigates</li>
<li><strong>Interrogating a witness:</strong> Mr. Salomone has information and she's going to get it</li>
<li><strong>Escalating pressure:</strong> Each threat gets more dramatic until he breaks</li>
<li><strong>Processing devastating news:</strong> Her world is literally crumbling with each revelation</li>
<li><strong>Physically reacting to horror:</strong> Her body reflects the emotional impact</li>
</ul>

<div class="physical-note">
<strong>Physical Gold Mine Alert:</strong> Eloise uses her entire body as a communication tool. She cartwheels to announce herself, threatens physical comedy to get information, and literally stumbles backward when her world starts falling apart. Your physicality should be as expressive as your voice.
</div>

<h3>Plaza Hotel Movement Style:</h3>
<p>This is elegant mischief, not chaotic energy. Eloise moves through the Plaza like she owns it (because she does), but she also respects the space. The cartwheel is playful but controlled. The threat to walk on her hands is dramatic but calculated. Even her stumble backward should have a theatrical quality—this is a girl who understands drama.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the entire frame. In this luxury setting, Eloise should command space like a tiny empress. Big gestures, expansive movement, and physical reactions that match the grandeur of her surroundings.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL LAYERS</h2>

<h3>What She's REALLY Saying:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Why today?"</strong> = <em>I know you're hiding something, and I'm not going anywhere until you tell me.</em></li>
<li><strong>"Don't make me walk on my hands."</strong> = <em>I will cause a scene in your precious lobby if you don't cooperate.</em></li>
<li><strong>"What's a Higginbottom?"</strong> = <em>This name sounds ridiculous and I'm going to make fun of it until you explain.</em></li>
<li><strong>"Mr. Plaza can't be recycled!"</strong> = <em>You can't just replace something perfect with something new!</em></li>
<li><strong>"No!" / "No!!"</strong> = <em>Each one is deeper horror as she realizes the scope of the threat.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Emotional Journey:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Confident Curiosity</strong> → <strong>Determined Investigation</strong> (something's up)</li>
<li><strong>Playful Threats</strong> → <strong>Victorious Information Gathering</strong> (I'm winning)</li>
<li><strong>Confused Processing</strong> → <strong>Growing Horror</strong> (this is bad)</li>
<li><strong>Mounting Panic</strong> → <strong>Complete Devastation</strong> (my world is ending)</li>
</ol>

<div class="bold-choice">
<strong>Secret Weapon:</strong> Eloise's horror isn't just about change—it's about losing her identity. The Plaza isn't just where she lives; it's WHO she is. Each thing Mr. Salomone mentions being changed is like erasing a piece of her soul.
</div>

<h3>Power of Precision:</h3>
<p>Every "No!" should be different. The first one is disbelief. The second one is horror. By the time he mentions high tea, it should be pure anguish. Chart this emotional escalation and make each reaction bigger than the last—but still truthful to a child's emotional reality.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6. CHARACTER POV & PERSONALIZATION</h2>

<h3>The Type (And How to Transcend It):</h3>
<p>Yes, Eloise could be seen as the "precocious rich kid." But that's surface level. The truth is: Eloise is a child who's been treated as an equal by adults her entire life, which means she's developed genuine wisdom and leadership skills alongside her natural curiosity. She's not bratty—she's empowered.</p>

<h3>Eloise's Unique Worldview:</h3>
<p><em>"The world is full of interesting people doing interesting things, and if you ask the right questions and refuse to accept boring answers, you can be part of any adventure you want."</em></p>

<h3>Your Signature Touches:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Curiosity:</strong> She doesn't just want to know things—she wants to understand them</li>
<li><strong>Natural Authority:</strong> She expects to be taken seriously because she always has been</li>
<li><strong>Protective Instinct:</strong> She's not just worried about change—she's defending her family (the hotel staff)</li>
<li><strong>Sophisticated Emotional Range:</strong> Her reactions are complex, not simple</li>
</ul>

<div class="comedy-gold">
<strong>Comedy Strategy:</strong> The humor comes from Eloise's absolute confidence that she's the most reasonable person in any room. She genuinely doesn't understand why adults find her difficult. Her logic is flawless—it's everyone else who's being weird.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>7. BOLD ACTING CHOICES</h2>

<div class="bold-choice">
<h3>The Trap vs. The Truth:</h3>
<p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Playing Eloise as "cute kid being precocious."</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Playing Eloise as "tiny CEO discovering her company is being sold."</p>
</div>

<h3>Surprising Shifts to Try:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vocal Choice:</strong> When she says "What's a Higginbottom?" make it sound like she's genuinely puzzled by this ridiculous word</li>
<li><strong>Physical Surprise:</strong> During the handstand threat, maybe she actually starts to do it—making Mr. Salomone panic</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Risk:</strong> Let her have a moment of genuine vulnerability when she realizes the Plaza might really change</li>
<li><strong>Power Dynamic:</strong> Play her as if she outranks Mr. Salomone (because in her mind, she does)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Levels and Variety Strategy:</h3>
<p>Don't stay on one emotional level. Eloise goes from playful to threatening to victorious to confused to horrified to devastated—all in three minutes. Map out each shift and make them clear. The bigger the range you show, the more impressive your audition becomes.</p>

<div class="coach-note">
<strong>Bold Choice Alert:</strong> What if Eloise has a moment where she goes completely still and quiet when processing the worst news? Sometimes the biggest reaction is no reaction at all—just a child's mind trying to process something too big to understand.
</div>

<h3>The Cartwheel Challenge:</h3>
<p>If you can't do a real cartwheel, don't fake it badly. Instead, substitute it with some other physical action that shows Eloise's confidence and slight disregard for lobby decorum. Maybe she slides across the marble floor, or does a little spin, or walks backward while talking. Make it YOUR version of Eloise's entrance.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>8. MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON</h2>

<h3>Your Moment Before:</h3>
<p>You've just been having an adventure with Levi, probably showing him some secret Plaza location or teaching him the proper way to slide down the banister. You're in a great mood, feeling very pleased with yourself for making a new friend. You cartwheel into the lobby expecting to find the usual boring adult business, but instead you sense something different in the air. Your curiosity sensor is immediately activated.</p>

<h3>The Button (Your Secret Weapon):</h3>
<p>After Mr. Salomone mentions canceling high tea and you stumble backward, you have a choice for how to end this beat:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Complete devastation—let us see a little girl who's truly overwhelmed for the first time</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Determination—her jaw sets as she realizes she's going to have to fix this</li>
<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Strategic retreat—she's gathering information for her counterattack</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose the one that feels most true to YOUR version of Eloise.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>9. REHEARSAL & EXPERIMENTATION GAME PLAN</h2>

<h3>Your 10+ Takes Strategy:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take 1:</strong> Full confidence mode—Eloise as tiny empress demanding answers</li>
<li><strong>Take 2:</strong> More playful—emphasize the fun of getting information out of Mr. Salomone</li>
<li><strong>Take 3:</strong> Detective mode—she's investigating a mystery, not just asking questions</li>
<li><strong>Take 4:</strong> Focus on the relationship—how much she genuinely likes Mr. Salomone</li>
<li><strong>Take 5:</strong> Emphasize her growing horror as she realizes the scope of the threat</li>
<li><strong>Takes 6-10:</strong> Mix and match what worked, experiment with different entrances and different emotional builds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Experimentation:</h3>
<p>Try the scene standing, sitting, moving constantly, or staying perfectly still. Eloise should probably be in motion for most of it—she's too energetic and curious to stay static. But find moments where she freezes (when processing shocking information) or explodes into movement (when making threats).</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Memorization Strategy:</strong> Don't memorize the words—memorize the emotional journey. Know that you start confident, get playful, win the information, then spiral into horror. The exact words will come when you're living truthfully in each moment.
</div>

<h3>React Like You're Really There:</h3>
<p>Even though your reader is off-camera, really listen to their delivery. If Mr. Salomone sounds tired, let that inform how hard you push. If he sounds amused by your threats, get more dramatic. If he sounds genuinely upset about the changes, let that scare you more. Stay alive in the scene.</p>

<h3>Alternative Take Preparation:</h3>
<p>If they ask for something different, try "Eloise with more vulnerability." Same determination and curiosity, but let us see that underneath all that confidence is a little girl who's never faced real uncertainty before. This could show beautiful range while still honoring the character.</p>
</div>

<div class="prep-checklist">
<h2>YOUR ELOISE ACTION PLAN</h2>
<ul>
<li>☐ Practice your entrance—whatever physical choice you make, own it completely</li>
<li>☐ Map out every emotional shift in the scene (at least 6 major ones)</li>
<li>☐ Work on your interrogation technique—how does Eloise extract information?</li>
<li>☐ Practice escalating the threats—make each one more dramatic than the last</li>
<li>☐ Find your version of each "No!"—disbelief, horror, anguish</li>
<li>☐ Work on the stumble backward—is it devastation, determination, or strategy?</li>
<li>☐ Practice using the entire frame—Eloise commands space</li>
<li>☐ Rehearse with genuine curiosity—Eloise NEEDS to understand</li>
<li>☐ Find the moments of real connection with Mr. Salomone</li>
<li>☐ Remember: You're not a kid acting grown-up, you're a person who happens to be young</li>
</ul>

<div class="eloise-magic" style="margin-top: 25px;">
<p><strong>Final Pep Talk:</strong> You're not auditioning to play a child. You're auditioning to play a force of nature who happens to be seven years old. Eloise doesn't see herself as "just a kid"—she sees herself as the most interesting person in any room. Your job is to make casting believe that's absolutely true. Show them an Eloise who's impossible to forget, impossible to dismiss, and absolutely impossible to say no to. The Plaza Hotel is her kingdom, and you're about to prove why.</p>
