AUDITION PREPARATION GUIDE: NINA
AUDITION PREPARATION GUIDE: NINA
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reboot Series
Alright, you've got NINA sides! This is THE lead role - the new Slayer herself. Let's break down
everything to help you nail this audition and become the next iconic hero in the Buffyverse!

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Type: Television Series (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reboot)
Genre: Supernatural Action Drama/Horror with Teen Elements
Tone & Style: Coming-of-age drama meets supernatural adventure; balances intensity with sharp
humor
Comparable Projects: Original "Buffy," "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina," "Stranger Things,"
"Yellowjackets"
Scene Context: These sides show two pivotal early scenes - Nina arguing with her overprotective
father about independence, and Nina revealing vulnerability with a teacher who sees her potential

2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN
Who is Nina?
A 16-year-old intellectual introvert who's brilliant academically but socially awkward. She's been
raised by an overprotective single father (her mother left when she was five). Nina has no idea she's
destined to become a supernatural warrior and protector.
How does Nina see herself?
As a brain, not a fighter. She values intelligence over physical prowess and feels most comfortable in
books where relationships and rules make sense. Nina sees herself as incomplete - blaming herself
for her mother leaving.
How do others see Nina?
Her father sees her as fragile and in need of protection. Mrs. LaBelle sees her untapped potential as a
leader. Most peers likely see her as the standoffish smart girl who doesn't quite fit in.
Character Reference Points:
Think early Willow's intelligence with early Buffy's resistance to her calling, plus some Eleven from
"Stranger Things" (hidden power), and Arya Stark's journey from bookish girl to warrior.

3. UTA HAGEN'S QUESTIONS (CUSTOMIZED TO THE SCENE)

Who am I?

my overprotective father since my mother abandoned us when I was five. I'm unaware of my destiny
as a Slayer.

Scene 2: Empty classroom, school supplies, the teacher who both challenges and understands me
What are my relationships?
Scene 1: With Alan (Dad) - love mixed with frustration at his overprotection
Scene 2: With Mrs. LaBelle - intellectual respect, antagonism, but also an unexpected ally
What are the circumstances?

program I applied to without telling him

social
What's in my way?

Scene 2: Mrs. LaBelle's concern that my academic brilliance isn't enough for real-world success
How do I get what I want?
Scene 1: By confronting my father directly, by articulating my maturity, by making him understand
Scene 2: By trying to leverage my academic excellence, then by reluctantly sharing something
personal

4. SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY
Scene 1: Home

Start physically burdened (juggling keys, backpack)
FREEZE moment when you hear about the school calling
DROPPING the backpack - make this a dramatic physical punctuation
As you soften toward your dad, physically soften (shoulders relaxing, voice gentler)
Show your eyes PLEADING at the pivotal moment
Scene 2: Classroom
Show NERVOUSNESS as you approach teacher
Take a beat to be GOBSMACKED when she says "no"
Demonstrate physical discomfort when discussing "the real world"
Physical WITHDRAWAL when personal topic of your mother comes up - subtle pulling back

5. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL DEPTH
Scene 1 Subtext:
"I'm allowed to go upstairs" = "Stop controlling me"
"I can handle it" = "I need you to believe in me"
"I'm 16 years old" = "I'm not a child anymore"
"You're scared" = "I understand your fear but I need to grow"
Scene 2 Subtext:
"I'm not here to debate my grade" = "I respect your authority but need something from you"
"I have straight As" = "I've succeeded by society's metrics, why isn't it enough?"
"I don't like to talk about it" = "This wound is too deep to share casually"
Final silence after Mrs. LaBelle's "main character" comment = "I'm terrified of taking center stage
in my own life"

6. CHARACTER POV & UNIQUE PERSONALIZATION
Nina's Unique Worldview:
Books/education are safe harbors in an unpredictable world
Social interaction is dangerous/uncomfortable territory
Intelligence is her identity and armor
She fears abandonment (mother left) and being the center of attention
She's both craving and terrified of independence
Making Nina Fresh:
Unexpected moments of physical confidence that contrast with her social awkwardness

Quick, sharp wit that surprises even herself
A specific physical habit when thinking (adjusting glasses, tucking hair, fidgeting with a book)
Subtle hints of strength that foreshadow her Slayer destiny

7. BOLD ACTING CHOICES
Emotional Progression Scene 1:
1. Rushed/evasive â†’ stunned/caught â†’ defensive â†’ vulnerable â†’ determined
2. Find moments where Nina's intellectual wit contrasts with teen emotional reactions
3. Make us see both the child afraid of abandonment AND the warrior waiting to emerge
Emotional Progression Scene 2:
1. Determined/confident â†’ defensive â†’ intellectually combative â†’ vulnerable â†’ withdrawn
2. Show flashes of passion that reveal the fighter beneath the bookworm
3. Let us see how her trauma has shaped both her strength and her fear
Vocal Choices:
Start with clipped, fast intellectual speech that slows when emotions enter
Find places to drop volume for impact ("My mom. She left.")
Use pauses strategically to show moments of realization or vulnerability

8. CREATE MOMENT BEFORE AND BUTTON
Moment Before Scene 1:
You've been somewhere your dad wouldn't approve of - perhaps researching something mysterious,
or simply being independent. You're trying to sneak in without a confrontation, heart racing slightly.
Button for Scene 1:
After your dad says "Never," add a small gesture that shows both hurt and resolve - perhaps
straightening your posture slightly to show you won't give up this fight.
Moment Before Scene 2:
You've rehearsed exactly what to say to get this recommendation letter, approaching this like a
logical problem to solve rather than a social interaction.
Button for Scene 2:
After being described as "terrified to accept that possibility," let us see a brief flash of both
recognition and resistance - the first hint that you might indeed have to become the hero of your own
story.

9. REHEARSAL & EXPERIMENTATION

Compare/Contrast: Practice transitioning between "Book Nina" (intellectual, controlled) and
glimpses of "Slayer Nina" (powerful, passionate)
Experiment with Timing: Try rushing your intellectual arguments then slowing down for
emotional revelations
Energy Variations: Run Scene 1 with simmering anger, then with terrified vulnerability
Physical Life: Develop a specific "book smart kid" physicality that occasionally breaks when
emotion takes over
Create a Specific Memory: Decide exactly what happened when your mom left and how it felt
Father Relationship: Practice with someone playing Alan at different emotional levels
Special Skills: If you have martial arts or athletic training, find subtle ways to incorporate hints of
physical capability that Nina herself doesn't recognize
