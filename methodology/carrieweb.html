<h1>CARRIE CALLBACK AUDITION GUIDE</h1>
<p class="intro">A Complete Acting Breakdown for Your Callback Success</p>

<div class="intro">
    <p>Hey there! Let's break down this incredible role so you can absolutely crush this callback. Carrie is such a fascinating character with SO much emotional range - from painfully sheltered to surprisingly bold. Let's dive into what makes her tick in each scene and how to nail these completely different emotional journeys.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene-header">
    <div class="scene-title">SCENE 1: THE CURIOUS NEWCOMER</div>
    <div class="scene-description">This first scene is all about Carrie's genuine curiosity about the world. You're not playing "awkward" - you're playing hungry for knowledge. There's a massive difference!</div>
</div>

<p>Think about it: Carrie hasn't been socialized like other teens. She doesn't know she should be embarrassed about not knowing things. Everything is just... fascinating information to collect.</p>

<div class="emotional-notes">
<h3>Key Emotional Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wide-eyed wonder</strong>: The school environment is like an alien planet you're exploring</li>
    <li><strong>Earnest questions</strong>: Zero filter between your thoughts and what you say</li>
    <li><strong>No social awareness</strong>: You don't catch sarcasm because you've never experienced it</li>
    <li><strong>Formal politeness</strong>: Your mom taught you manners, just not teen social dynamics</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Acting Choices to Make:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Physical openness - don't curl in on yourself like a typical "shy kid"</li>
    <li>Direct eye contact when asking questions (you're genuinely interested!)</li>
    <li>Slight head tilt when processing new information</li>
    <li>Quick, eager responses - no teen hesitation or coolness</li>
</ol>

<div class="warning">
<h3>Pitfalls to Avoid:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> play her as fearful or timid - she's not afraid, just uninformed</li>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> play her as weird or "outcast" - she doesn't know she's different yet</li>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> add modern teen mannerisms she wouldn't have picked up yet</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Gold Acting Moment:</strong> When Chris says "Love that for you" with sarcasm, Carrie should genuinely think it's a nice thing to say. That's what makes this character so heartbreaking - her openness makes her vulnerable.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene-header">
    <div class="scene-title">SCENE 2: CONFRONTING YOUR BULLY</div>
    <div class="scene-description">This scene is DYNAMITE. You're literally battling both your external tormentor AND your internal rage (personified as Emaline).</div>
</div>

<p>Think about what it takes to finally confront someone who's been systematically destroying you - the courage, the vulnerability, the desperation to simply understand WHY.</p>

<div class="emotional-notes">
<h3>Key Emotional Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internal struggle</strong>: Physically show the effort to silence Emaline's violent suggestions</li>
    <li><strong>Raw vulnerability</strong>: The real question isn't accusatory - it's a genuine plea to understand</li>
    <li><strong>Flashes of strength</strong>: Brief moments where your true power peeks through</li>
    <li><strong>Disbelief</strong>: When Chris turns it around to claim YOU'RE destroying HER life</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Acting Choices to Make:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create a physical "silencing" gesture when blocking out Emaline (closed eyes, slight shake of head)</li>
    <li>Use your voice differently when speaking to Emaline vs. Chris</li>
    <li>Step forward with purpose when asking "why me?"</li>
    <li>Show a flicker of hope when Chris almost apologizes</li>
</ol>

<div class="takes-breakdown">
<h3>Three-Take Approach:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Take 1 (Natural)</strong>: Lead with genuine confusion and hurt</li>
    <li><strong>Take 2 (Bold)</strong>: Channel controlled rage - low voice, direct eye contact, minimal movement</li>
    <li><strong>Take 3 (Vulnerable)</strong>: Voice slightly breaking, eyes welling up but forcing yourself to stay present</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="strength-note">
<p><strong>Why This Scene Works:</strong> We see Carrie choosing to be better than her tormentor. The restraint is what makes it powerful.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene-header">
    <div class="scene-title">SCENE 3: FINDING YOUR VOICE</div>
    <div class="scene-description">This scene is Carrie's full transformation moment - from someone who was invisible to someone who commands an entire auditorium.</div>
</div>

<p>This is NOT about confidence in the traditional sense. It's about clarity of purpose. You're not playing "confident public speaker" - you're playing "person who finally sees something clearly enough to overcome their fear."</p>

<div class="emotional-notes">
<h3>Key Emotional Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unexpected courage</strong>: Even you're surprised you stood up</li>
    <li><strong>Growing conviction</strong>: Voice strengthens as you continue speaking</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: This isn't rehearsed - these words are coming from deep inside</li>
    <li><strong>Universality</strong>: You're making this about everyone, not just yourself</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Acting Choices to Make:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start with a slightly unsteady voice that gains resonance</li>
    <li>Take your time - let important words land</li>
    <li>Make eye contact with different sections of the "auditorium"</li>
    <li>Small, authentic gestures (not practiced "speech" gestures)</li>
    <li>A moment of vulnerability when addressing your mother directly</li>
</ol>

<div class="warning">
<h3>Pitfalls to Avoid:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> suddenly become a polished orator - maintain some rawness</li>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> make it angry - this is about vision, not vengeance</li>
    <li><strong>DON'T</strong> rush through it - let the power build naturally</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="character-arc">
<h2>OVERALL CHARACTER JOURNEY</h2>
<p>What's fascinating about these three scenes is they show Carrie's complete arc:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
    <li><strong>Scene 1:</strong> Who she was (innocent, unformed)</li>
    <li><strong>Scene 2:</strong> Who she is becoming (questioning, finding inner strength)</li>
    <li><strong>Scene 3:</strong> Who she could be (visionary, leader)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Your challenge is making these feel like the same person at different stages, not three different characters.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="prep-section">
<h2>PRACTICAL PREP TIPS</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Create physical anchors</strong> for each version of Carrie - maybe a specific way of standing or holding your hands</li>
    
    <li><strong>Find the vocal progression</strong> - from curious/questioning in Scene 1, to direct/confrontational in Scene 2, to resonant/inspiring in Scene 3</li>
    
    <li><strong>Watch teenage documentaries</strong> - not teen movies! Real teens in interviews have an authenticity that scripted teen shows often lack</li>
    
    <li><strong>Practice transitions</strong> - how quickly can you shift between Carrie talking to Emaline versus Carrie talking to Chris?</li>
    
    <li><strong>Trust silence</strong> - especially in Scene 2, the moments where you're NOT speaking might be your most powerful</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="pro-tip center">
<p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> Remember, Carrie is an outsider who gains power not by becoming like everyone else, but by embracing what makes her different. That journey from isolation to self-actualization is what makes this character so freaking compelling.</p>
<p><em>Go get 'em! And let me know if you want to drill down on any particular moment or emotional beat!</em></p>
