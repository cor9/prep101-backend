- "Here's the truth about Shaggy: He's not the comic relief sidekick. He's the emotional heart of this story."
- "Juniper isn't the girl who announces herself when she walks into a room. She's the one you realize you've been watching the entire time."
- "Foster Dade isn't just another sensitive outsider—he's the unreliable narrator of his own downfall."

**BAD**
- "This is a comedy scene about a girl selling cookies."
- "Shaggy is a teenage boy dealing with family issues."

## Character Shortcuts (Metaphors)

## Subtext Translations

**GOOD**
