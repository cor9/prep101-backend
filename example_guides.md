Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
Audition Preparation Guide
SCOOBY-DOO - Netflix Streaming Pilot
Here's the truth about Shaggy: He's not the comic relief sidekick. He's the emotional heart of this story—a kid who loved mysteries so much that solving one destroyed his world. That's your way in.
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Type: Netflix Streaming Series (Pilot)

Genre: Nostalgic Mystery/Coming-of-Age Drama with Humor

Tone & Style: This is NOT Saturday morning cartoon Shaggy. This is grounded, emotionally complex, prestige teen television. Think "Stranger Things" meets "Freaks and Geeks" with a mystery-solving dog. The humor comes from truth and character, not slapstick. This Shaggy feels REAL—a Brooklyn kid dealing with genuine trauma who uses humor as armor.

Comparable Projects:

"Stranger Things" (nostalgic tone, ensemble chemistry, emotional stakes)
"Euphoria" (raw honesty about teen pain, though less dark)
"Sex Education" (smart teens navigating real problems with humor)
"The End of the F***ing World" (deadpan delivery masking deep hurt)
Scene Context: These are TWO wildly different scenes that show Shaggy's range. Scene One is the reunion—surface-level "we're fine!" energy masking a year of loneliness. Scene Two is the explosion—where all that buried pain comes roaring out in a monologue that has to feel like watching a dam break.

Industry Reality Check: Netflix wants actors who can carry dramatic weight AND bring natural humor. They're looking for the kid who can make you laugh one minute and break your heart the next. This role is a series regular for a reason—Shaggy's arc is the emotional spine of the show.
2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN: THE REAL SHAGGY
Who Is Norville "Shaggy" Rogers?
On the surface: A loose-limbed, larky Brooklyn kid who knows every Agatha Christie novel by heart and organizes his food with the precision of a forensic scientist.

Underneath: A teenager whose detective skills—the thing he was MOST proud of—became the instrument of his family's destruction. Shaggy learned that finding the truth doesn't always set you free. Sometimes it just burns your whole world down.

"What's the point of finding out the truth when all that lies on the other side is heartbreak and pain?"

This isn't a rhetorical question for Shaggy. It's his fundamental wound.
How Shaggy Sees Himself:
A fuck-up who destroyed his family. A kid who thought he was playing detective and ended up being the reason his mom cried into her Pad See Ew at their favorite Thai restaurant. Someone who took the skills his dad taught him and used them to blow up his parents' marriage.

How Others See Him:
Daphne sees her friend who's been MIA all year—the guy she genuinely missed, even if she's been too busy/embarrassed to admit it. Bobo (and others) probably see the funny Brooklyn kid with the weird name who knows random mystery trivia. Nobody knows about the family explosion except Shaggy.

Your Bridge to Shaggy (Find Your Connection):
Ever felt responsible for something that wasn't really your fault?
Do you use humor to deflect when things get too real?
Have you ever been genuinely excited about something nerdy and specific (like mystery novels)?
Ever had a friendship drift for a year and then tried to act like everything's fine?
Do you know what it's like when adults put adult decisions on you?
The Empathy Stretch (What's Different):
Shaggy's carrying trauma that would crush most teens
He's internalized blame for his father's affair—which is objectively NOT his fault
His love of mysteries has been poisoned by one terrible discovery
He's from Brooklyn (if you're not, study that accent/rhythm)
His defense mechanisms are more developed than most 16-year-olds
Character Gold: Shaggy isn't avoiding mysteries because he's scared of danger. He's avoiding them because he knows firsthand that truth can be more destructive than ignorance. That's a COMPLETELY different character motivation than cartoon Shaggy's cowardice.
The Type (And How to Explode It):
Yes, Shaggy's "the funny sidekick" in pop culture. But this version is so much more—he's the wounded idealist, the reluctant detective, the kid who learned that growing up means discovering your heroes have feet of clay (and maybe mistresses named Jocelyn).

Archetype Reference: Think of Shaggy as "The Wounded Healer" meets "The Reluctant Hero" with a dash of "The Wise Fool." He's Holden Caulfield meets Sherlock Holmes meets every kid who ever discovered their parents were just flawed humans.
3. UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (SHAGGY EDITION)
Scene One: The Reunion (Pages 15-16)
Who am I?
I'm Norville "Shaggy" Rogers, 16, from Brooklyn. I'm that kid who can quote every mystery novel ever written but can't figure out how to text my best friend back because I'm too ashamed to admit my year was terrible. I'm funny because it's easier than being honest. I'm the kid whose detective skills blew up his family, and I'm desperately trying to act like I'm fine.

Where am I?
Summer camp—my reset button, my safe place. The one location where I can pretend to be the kid I was before I discovered my dad was cheating. I'm at a Greyhound bus stop watching Daphne arrive, and suddenly I have to perform "Everything's Great!" when everything is decidedly not great.

What time is it?
First day of summer camp—fresh start energy, reunion vibes. But there's also a year of silence hanging between us. It's that weird moment when you see someone you care about after a long gap and you both have to decide: Are we going to be real, or are we going to lie?

What surrounds me?
The camp environment—other kids arriving, parents saying goodbye, the bustle of a new summer beginning. There's possibility in the air, but also pressure. Everyone's performing their summer selves. The heat, the dust, the weight of a backpack. The Greyhound pulling away after delivering Daphne—a perfect metaphor for leaving your winter behind.

What are the relationships?
Daphne is my friend who I've been avoiding for a year. She owes me texts; I sent her forty (FORTY!) messages she never answered. But weirdly, I'm not mad. I'm just... glad to see her. She represents everything good about summer camp—the version of myself I get to be when real life isn't crushing me.

What are the circumstances?
It's been a year since we've seen each other. In that year: my dad had an affair with his secretary Jocelyn, I discovered it by playing detective, I told my mom, my parents divorced, my whole world exploded. Daphne doesn't know any of this. She thinks I'm the same kid from last summer.

What do I want?
To convince Daphne (and myself) that everything's amazing. To get back to the easy friendship we had before. To prove that I'm still fun, still normal, still the guy she wants to be around. Deeper: I want to believe my own lie—that my year actually WAS "the best."

What's in my way?
The truth. The forty unanswered texts sitting between us. My shame about what happened with my family. The fact that I know she's lying too—her year wasn't "amazing." We're both performing, and part of me wants to drop the act, but I literally don't know how.

How do I get what I want?
Deflect with humor. Make the forty texts into a joke about flossing between dentist visits (that's SUCH a Shaggy line—turning pain into something absurd and funny). Agree enthusiastically to the musical audition even though I'll probably be terrible. Show her I'm still the same easy-going friend she remembers. Lock my trauma in a box and throw away the key.

Scene Two: The Explosion (Pages 54-57)
Who am I?
I'm still Shaggy, but now all the walls are down. I'm the kid who's been carrying this secret for months, and Bobo just asked exactly the wrong (right?) question. I'm exhausted from pretending. I'm angry—at my dad, at myself, at the entire concept of truth. I'm the detective who wishes he'd never solved the case.

Where am I?
Somewhere at camp with Bobo. Private enough that I can explode. Maybe we're away from the main areas—behind a cabin, in the woods, somewhere I can let everything out without an audience. The location doesn't matter as much as the fact that I've hit my breaking point.

What time is it?
Later in the summer. Days or weeks after that first reunion with Daphne. Enough time has passed that whatever I've been holding in has fermented into rage. It's probably late afternoon or evening—emotional confession time, when defenses are down.

What surrounds me?
Bobo's confusion and growing horror. The suffocating weight of my own story. Every detail I'm remembering—Jocelyn kicking off her shoes and running out, my mom weeping into Thai food, my dad's face when he got home from poker night to find The Apocalypse waiting. I'm surrounded by memories that play like a nightmare.

What are the relationships?
Bobo's probably a friend, or at least someone I trust enough to finally tell the truth to. He asked about my dad's job, which opened the floodgate. He's about to get WAY more information than he bargained for. Our relationship is about to fundamentally change—he's going to see the real, broken Shaggy.

What are the circumstances?
Everything from Scene One, plus: I've been at camp trying to be "normal" Shaggy, probably avoiding mystery-related activities, definitely not being myself. Something Bobo said triggered me. Maybe he was asking innocent questions about my family, not realizing he was poking a wound.

What do I want?
To make Bobo UNDERSTAND why I'm done with mysteries. To purge this story that's been poisoning me. To make someone else carry this weight with me so I'm not alone anymore. To prove that I had good reasons for destroying my family—that it wasn't just dumb-ass junior detective bullshit, except it WAS, and that's why I hate myself.

What's in my way?
Nothing and everything. The story itself is the obstacle—reliving it means re-experiencing the worst moments of my life. Admitting out loud that I "blew up our whole world" means accepting responsibility I can't handle. The fact that explaining won't change anything.

How do I get what I want?
Tell it like a mystery story—ironically using the very skills I'm trying to reject. Walk him through the investigation: the odd travel, strange hours, exciting possibilities (Spy? Assassin? CIA?). Build the case like a detective would. Then deliver the devastating truth: It wasn't cool at all. It was just an affair. Make him feel every step of my decision-making process, from discovering the affair to telling my mom at the Thai restaurant to watching my dad come home to The Apocalypse. Make him understand that being a detective destroyed everything I loved.

4. SCENE-BY-SCENE BREAKDOWN
SCENE ONE: The Reunion - "Just, like... Five or Twenty Texts... Maybe Forty?"
The Emotional Arc:
Nervous Anticipation → Genuine Relief → Performed Casualness → Real Connection → Mutual Hope
Beat-by-Beat Analysis:
BEAT 1: The Greeting
"Heyyy --" / "Shaggy!"

Surface: Hey, my friend!
Subtext: Oh thank god, a familiar face. Please still like me. I've missed this more than I can say.
Physical Life: The moment of recognition—his face lights up genuinely. Maybe his whole body relaxes for the first time all day. He probably starts moving toward her before he even says her name.
BEAT 2: The Apology Preempt
"Before you say anything, I feel like I owe you some texts back --" / "Nah. All good."

Surface: No worries about the texts!
Subtext: Please don't apologize because then I'll have to acknowledge how much it hurt that you ghosted me for a year. Let's just skip past the awkward part and get back to being friends.
Physical Life: A dismissive wave, a shrug, anything to make this NOT a big deal. Maybe he's already deflecting—looking around, adjusting his backpack, being busy with his hands.
BEAT 3: The Forty Text Confession
"Give it to me straight. I was too embarrassed to look. How many did I not return?"

Surface: Joke about the excessive texting.
Subtext: I need you to know I reached out. A lot. I needed you this year and you weren't there, but I'm going to make it funny so you don't feel guilty and so I don't have to admit how much it hurt.
Physical Life: This is where Shaggy's charm comes in—the delivery has to be self-deprecating but also slightly pointed. He's counting on his fingers maybe, or doing that thing where you make it absurd to avoid it being pathetic.
BEAT 4: The Dentist Metaphor
"Texting between summers is like flossing between dentist visits."

Surface: It's normal not to stay in touch!
Subtext: I'm giving us both an out. I'm saying it's fine that you ignored me, even though it wasn't fine. I'm being the bigger person because that's easier than being hurt.
Physical Life: This is vintage Shaggy—turning pain into a weird but accurate metaphor. He probably delivers this with a little laugh, like he's pleased with himself for coming up with it on the spot.
BEAT 5: The Mutual Recognition
"She takes him in for a beat. She's missed her friend."

Surface: Silent moment of connection.
Subtext: We both know we've been lying, and we both know the other person knows, and somehow that makes it okay. We're going to pretend together.
Physical Life: Don't rush this. Let her look at you. Let yourself be seen. This is the first honest moment in the scene—no words, just recognition. You might smile slightly, or your eyes might get a little sad before you cover it.
BEAT 6: The Mutual Lie
"You have a good year?" / "Amazing. Yours?" / "The best."

Surface: We both had great years!
Subtext: We're both lying through our teeth and we both know it and neither of us is brave enough to go first with the truth.
Physical Life: The staging note says "Neither of them willing to admit the truth about their winters of discontent." Play the lie big—maybe too big. Oversell it. That's what makes it work—the audience should KNOW you're both full of shit.
BEAT 7: The London Trip That Didn't Happen
"Did you and your Dad go to that Mystery Writer's Convention thingy in London?" / "Nah, it didn't end up happening..."

Surface: Trip got cancelled, no big deal.
Subtext: My dad and I aren't exactly speaking right now. Also, mysteries are a sore subject. Can we please talk about literally anything else?
Physical Life: First genuine deflation moment. Maybe he looks away. The "..." in the script is your friend—that trailing off tells you everything. Don't fill it with more words. Let the disappointment land.
BEAT 8: The Musical Proposition
"I was thinking about doing the musical this year..." / "Really?" / "Why is that so shocking?"

Surface: Surprised she wants to do the musical.
Subtext: Thank god we're off the topic of my family. Also, she's trying to change something about herself too—we're both looking for a reset.
Physical Life: His surprise should be genuine—this is new information. But watch how quickly he pivots to supportive. He WANTS this conversation. It's safe. It's about the future, not the past.
BEAT 9: "I'd probably end up being the plant."

Surface: Self-deprecating joke about his acting ability.
Subtext: I'll do anything you want if it means we get to be friends again. Also, making you laugh is my love language.
Physical Life: This should get a genuine laugh from Daphne. Play the ridiculousness—maybe mime being Audrey II. This is Shaggy at his most charming—the kid who can find the joke in any situation.
BEAT 10: The Agreement & The Smile
"You're doing it!" / "Okay, okay." / "And they share a smile. Happy to be back with each other."

Surface: We're going to audition for the musical together!
Subtext: We're going to be okay. This summer might actually save us both. Maybe we can be who we were before everything got complicated.
Physical Life: The script says "Happy to be back with each other." Play that. This is the emotional payoff of the scene—these two kids needed each other and they're finally admitting it (without actually saying it out loud).
Director's Note for Scene One: The entire scene is about what's NOT being said. Every joke is a defense mechanism. Every deflection is protecting something tender underneath. If you play just the surface, it'll be cute but empty. Play the WOUND underneath the humor, and suddenly we're watching something that hurts in the best way.
SCENE TWO: The Confession - "What's the point of finding out the truth?"
The Emotional Arc:
Controlled Testing → Rising Frustration → Explosive Storytelling → Bitter Revelation → Exhausted Resignation → Fundamental Question
Beat-by-Beat Analysis:
BEAT 1: The Setup Question
"Answer the question. Crack the case, big shot--" / "I don't know... Your dad's a lawyer or something?"

Surface: Testing Bobo's detective skills.
Subtext: I'm about to tell you something that's going to change how you see me. But first I need to show you that everyone gets it wrong. Everyone assumes the mundane explanation.
Physical Life: There's an edge here. "Big shot" is sarcastic—maybe even a little mean. Shaggy's already annoyed before the story even starts because he knows where this is going.
BEAT 2: The Investigation Begins
"That's what he always told people. But something didn't add up..."

Surface: Telling the detective story.
Subtext: This is where it all started—the moment I became a detective in my own life instead of just in books. This is where I stopped being a kid.
Physical Life: He probably shifts into storytelling mode—maybe pacing, maybe his hands start moving. He's been rehearsing this story in his head for months. It comes out polished, practiced, like a monologue he's delivered to himself a thousand times.
BEAT 3: The Exciting Possibilities
"Is his dad a spy? Or a government assassin? CIA maybe?"

Surface: These were my theories!
Subtext: See? I wasn't being paranoid. The evidence pointed to something INTERESTING. Something COOL. I was supposed to discover that my dad was a hero, not a cheater.
Physical Life: His energy might actually lift here—for a moment, he's back in the thrill of the investigation. He might almost smile, remembering how excited he was. That makes what comes next hurt even more.
BEAT 4: The Interruption
"Oh, man, that--" / "But Shaggy interrupts, on a rant --"

Surface: Can't let Bobo sympathize yet.
Subtext: Don't you dare feel sorry for me before you hear the worst part. Don't offer me comfort when I'm about to tell you how badly I fucked up.
Physical Life: The script says "on a rant"—this is where control slips. He literally can't stop now that he's started. It's pouring out. Maybe his voice gets louder. Maybe faster. He's not talking TO Bobo anymore; he's purging.
BEAT 5: The Discovery
"His Dad was having an affair! With his legal secretary, Jocelyn! Who we loved!"

Surface: The reveal of the affair.
Subtext: The world's cruelest punchline. I solved the mystery! I WON! Except winning meant losing everything. And Jocelyn—JOCELYN—who was practically family...
Physical Life: The exclamation points tell you everything. This isn't delivered quietly. This is sharp, bitter, maybe even shouted. Each sentence is a gut punch he's delivering to himself as much as to Bobo.
BEAT 6: The Impossible Choice
"'If you want to tell your mother, Shaggy, I understand...'"

Surface: Quoting his dad's words.
Subtext: He made it MY decision. He turned himself into the good guy by letting ME choose how to destroy our family. What kind of father does that?
Physical Life: Impersonate his dad here—maybe straighten up, maybe put on a "reasonable adult" voice. Make us see exactly how his dad tried to manipulate the situation into looking like compassion.
BEAT 7: The Week of Hell
"So I had to sit with it. For a week or so..."

Surface: The agony of knowing.
Subtext: I was completely alone with this information. A sixteen-year-old carrying an atom bomb of truth around for a week, overhearing my mom plan a birthday party for the man who was betraying her.
Physical Life: This should feel different—quieter maybe, more haunted. This is where the real pain lives, in the days between knowing and telling. Let us see the toll it took.
BEAT 8: The Confession Scene
"At the Thai restaurant on our block that we went to on Tuesday nights when Dad played poker..."

Surface: Where and when I told my mom.
Subtext: I destroyed our family ritual. That restaurant was OURS—Tuesday nights, Dad at poker, me and Mom eating Thai food and talking. I ruined the only special thing we had left.
Physical Life: The specific detail of "Pad See Ew" is devastating. Don't rush it. That's her favorite dish. That's the image Shaggy can't get out of his head—his mom crying into noodles.
BEAT 9: The Apocalypse
"He came back from his poker night and stepped right into The Apocalypse."

Surface: What happened when Dad got home.
Subtext: I orchestrated this. I lit the match. I could have kept the secret, but I didn't, and this is what happened.
Physical Life: "The Apocalypse" should land like a bomb. Capital T, capital A. This isn't just "they had a fight." This was world-ending. Biblical. Play that scope.
BEAT 10: The Self-Accusation
"So you see, Bobo, by being a dumb-ass junior detective, I blew up our whole world."

Surface: This is my fault.
Subtext: I need you to agree that I'm terrible so I can stop wondering if I'm terrible. Or I need you to tell me I'm not terrible so I can stop believing I am. I don't even know which one I want anymore.
Physical Life: This is the thesis statement—the whole reason he told the story. It's exhausted. Defeated. All the rage has burned itself out, and what's left is just this hollow certainty that he ruined everything.
BEAT 11: The Fundamental Question
"And that's why I'm done with mysteries. Because what's the point of finding out the truth when all that lies on the other side is heartbreak and pain?"

Surface: Philosophical question about truth-seeking.
Subtext: How do I live in a world where the thing I loved most—solving mysteries—became the thing that hurt me most? How do I trust myself ever again? How do I move forward when knowledge itself feels like a weapon?
Physical Life: This isn't really a question—it's a statement disguised as a question. He doesn't expect Bobo to answer. He probably walks off as the script indicates, leaving Bobo (and us) to sit with that devastating truth.
Director's Note for Scene Two: This monologue is a high-wire act. You have to build tension, vary your pacing, find the moments of dark humor, show us the rage AND the hurt, and land an emotional gut-punch—all while making it feel like spontaneous confession, not a rehearsed speech. The key is specificity: Every detail matters. "Jocelyn," "Pad See Ew," "Tuesday nights," "The Apocalypse"—these aren't just words, they're emotional grenades.
5. PHYSICALITY & VOCAL LIFE
Brooklyn Shaggy: The Physicality
The script describes him as "loose-limbed" and "larky"—let's break down what that actually means for your body:

Loose-Limbed: Shaggy's physicality is casual, easy, slightly lanky. He's not rigid or controlled. Think about teenage boys who haven't quite grown into their height yet—there's a natural looseness to how they move. He might:
Walk with his hands in his pockets
Lean against things rather than stand at attention
Use big, expressive hand gestures when he talks
Have a slight slouch (not bad posture, just relaxed)
Move fluidly—he's comfortable in his body despite the trauma
Larky: This word means playful, mischievous, inclined to mischief or adventure. Even with his trauma, Shaggy retains this quality. It means:
Quick to smile (even when it's covering pain)
Expressive face—his emotions flash across it
Tendency to make jokes with his body (the "plant" comment probably comes with a physical gag)
Energy that's UP rather than depressed (he's using humor/energy to mask, not withdrawing)
The Brooklyn Sound
Shaggy's from Brooklyn, which means:

Rhythm: Faster-paced than general American English. New Yorkers tend to speak quickly, especially when they're excited or upset.
Vowels: Research Brooklyn accent vowels—particularly the "aw" sound (coffee becomes "cawfee") and how "th" can sometimes soften.
Attitude: Brooklyn has a directness, a no-bullshit quality. Even when Shaggy's being funny, there's an underlying straight-shooter vibe.
BUT—Don't overdo it. Netflix wants authentic, not stereotypical. Listen to contemporary Brooklyn teens (YouTube, TikTok) not 1970s Scorsese characters.
Accent Strategy: Unless you're FROM Brooklyn, aim for a subtle suggestion of accent rather than a thick one. A few word choices, a slight rhythm shift, a tiny vowel adjustment—that's all you need. Overdoing accents in auditions almost always backfires. Let the character's attitude and rhythm do most of the work.
Vocal Variety: The Key to Both Scenes
Scene One requires:

Light, playful tone at the top (covering nervousness)
Self-deprecating humor (the forty texts)
Slight deflation when the London trip comes up
Warmth when connecting with Daphne
Building enthusiasm about the musical (even if it's performed)
Scene Two requires:

Controlled storytelling at the beginning
Building energy/intensity as the story unfolds
Sharp, bitter humor ("Who we loved!")
Rage when describing his dad's "choice"
Haunted quietness during the week of knowing
Exhausted defeat at the end
Pro Tip: Record yourself doing Scene Two three different ways: (1) Mostly angry, (2) Mostly hurt, (3) A mix. Listen back. Which one feels most TRUE? Most actors will instinctively go too hard on the anger. The hurt underneath is what makes it devastating.
Silence & Stillness: Your Secret Weapons
Look at Scene One: "She takes him in for a beat. She's missed her friend."

That's a GIFT. That silent beat is where the real acting happens. Don't rush it. Let her look at you. Let us see seventeen emotions cross your face in two seconds. That moment of genuine connection before you both go back to lying? That's gold.

In Scene Two, find the moments to pause:

After "Who we loved!" (let that sink in)
After describing the week of sitting with the secret (let us feel the weight)
After "blew up our whole world" (let Bobo absorb what you just said)
The final question should hang in the air
6. BOLD CHOICES THAT BOOK ROLES
Safe is boring. Interesting is bookable. You're auditioning for NETFLIX. They want RANGE.
Scene One: Where Most Actors Go Wrong
The Trap: Playing the whole scene as "awkward reunion."

The Trap: Making Shaggy desperate or needy about the forty texts.

The Trap: Playing all the hurt/trauma upfront.

The Bold Move:

Play the RELIEF of seeing Daphne. He's genuinely happy. Yes, there's complexity underneath, but his first emotion is joy.
Make the "forty texts" moment FUNNY. Own the absurdity. He's laughing at himself, which is charming as hell.
The lies about having a great year should be BIG. Almost too enthusiastic. That's what makes them obviously lies.
Find one micro-moment of genuine vulnerability (I recommend the moment after she says she's missed him—let yourself almost break before covering it with the musical conversation).
Scene Two: The Monologue Trap
The Trap: Treating it like a prepared monologue (polished, performed).

The Trap: Going full rage the whole time.

The Trap: Making it melodramatic or soap-opera.

The Bold Move:

Start CONTROLLED. He's telling a detective story. There's almost a rhythm to it—he's done this in his head a thousand times.
Let it BREAK when Bobo tries to sympathize. That's when the rant takes over. That's when he loses control.
Find the moments of dark humor. "Piece of shit---" should land like a punch, but there's something almost funny about how viciously he says it. That's very Brooklyn.
The detail about his mom's "Pad See Ew"—that's the most specific, painful detail in the whole speech. Make us SEE her crying into those noodles. That's what audiences remember.
The question at the end isn't rhetorical—play it like he's genuinely asking. Like he's hoping Bobo might have an answer he hasn't thought of.
Surprise Casting with Shifts: What if during the "exciting possibilities" section (spy, assassin, CIA), Shaggy actually gets EXCITED remembering how cool he thought it would be? Let him light up for five seconds, reliving that thrill—then make the crash into "his dad was having an affair" even more brutal by contrast. That shift from hope to devastation is what makes the audience feel it in their gut.
Your Alternative Take (For Callbacks)
If they ask you to try something different, here's your secret weapon:

Scene One Alternative: "Shaggy who's DONE pretending." What if instead of going along with the mutual lie, he actually calls it out? When Daphne says "Amazing," what if he gives her a look that says "Really?" Nothing mean—just a gentle "Come on, we both know that's bullshit." It changes the dynamic completely and shows you understand the subtext.

Scene Two Alternative: "Shaggy who's numb instead of angry." What if instead of rage, he tells this story with an almost eerie calm? Like he's so far past anger that he's in a different emotional space entirely. It's chilling in a different way and shows enormous range.

7. THE MOMENT BEFORE & THE BUTTON
Scene One: Your Moment Before
Sixty seconds before Daphne's bus pulls up, you're standing there scanning every vehicle, every person getting off. You're nervous—what if she doesn't recognize you? What if the friendship is gone? What if she asks about your year and you can't keep the lie going?

Thirty seconds before: Another bus, not hers. Your stomach drops. Maybe she's not coming.

Ten seconds before: You see the Greyhound. She's ON that bus. Your heart rate spikes.

One second before: Deep breath. Game face on. Be the fun guy. Be the kid she remembers.

Then: You see her face. And suddenly it's easy again.

Scene One: Your Button
After "And they share a smile. Happy to be back with each other," you have choices:

A genuine laugh—relief that this is going to be okay
Impulsively pulling her into a hug (if that fits your Shaggy)
A moment where you both just LOOK at each other, and it's real
Starting to walk toward camp together, already talking about Little Shop
Scene Two: Your Moment Before
You've been at camp for a while now. You've been GOOD. You haven't talked about your dad. You've done activities. You've been "Shaggy." But it's exhausting.

Sixty seconds before this conversation: Bobo asks some innocent question about your family or your dad's job. Something breaks open.

Thirty seconds before: You try to deflect, but he keeps asking. He's curious. He doesn't know he's poking a wound.

Ten seconds before: You make a decision. Fuck it. I'm telling him.

One second before: You gear up to tell the story the way you've rehearsed it in your head—like a mystery to be solved.

Then: It all comes pouring out.

Scene Two: Your Button
"Shaggy walks off. Bobo watches him go."

This is your physical punctuation mark. How does he walk away?

Exhausted—shoulders down, all energy drained
Angry—sharp movements, maybe kicking something
Numb—zombie-like, not really seeing where he's going
Determined—like he just made a vow to himself
Pick the one that feels most true to YOUR Shaggy. The button tells us where he is emotionally AFTER the explosion. Is he empty? Still raging? Resolved? That's your final acting choice.

Take 6 - Play the Guilt: You blame yourself more than anyone
Take 7 - Play the Exhaustion: You're just SO tired of carrying this
Take 8 - Play Dark Humor: Find every bitter laugh in the text
Take 9 - Play the Question: The ending question is genuinely seeking an answer
Take 10 - Your Signature Take: Combine all the discoveries into YOUR Shaggy
Critical Reminder: Do NOT memorize line readings. Memorize the emotional journey, the beats, the intentions. The specific words will come naturally when you're living truthfully in the moment. If you sound rehearsed, you're dead in the water.
Working with Your Reader
Your reader (or your scene partner if you're lucky enough to have one) is giving you GIFTS:

In Scene One:

When Daphne sounds apologetic—let that soften you
When she sounds embarrassed—make her feel better with your humor
When she sounds warm—let yourself believe the friendship is still there
When she sounds excited about the musical—match that energy
In Scene Two:

When Bobo sounds confused—use that to fuel your frustration
When he tries to sympathize—cut him off, you're not done
When he's shocked—let that validate your story
His silence after you finish—use it, don't fill it
9. THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHY SHAGGY MATTERS
This isn't just about booking a role (though that would be amazing). This is about understanding what makes a character resonate with audiences:

Shaggy represents every kid who ever discovered their parents were flawed humans. He represents the loss of innocence that comes with growing up. He represents the pain of realizing that truth and justice don't always lead to happy endings. He's funny because he HAS to be—humor is his survival mechanism.
When you play Shaggy, you're playing:

The kid who blamed himself for adult problems
The detective who wishes he'd never solved the case
The friend who uses jokes to keep people from seeing his pain
The teenager learning that growing up means accepting gray areas
The loyal friend who shows up even when he's falling apart inside
This Is Why Casting Cares: Shaggy isn't the comic relief in this version. He's the emotional center. He's the one asking the hard questions about truth, family, and what it means to be a detective when solving mysteries has consequences. The actor who gets this role will carry significant dramatic weight across the entire series. They're not looking for someone who can just be funny—they need someone who can break your heart.
The Nostalgia Factor
Everyone knows cartoon Shaggy—the coward who loves his dog and his sandwiches. This version honors that (the food organization detail, the Brooklyn accent, the humor) while making him REAL. You're playing a character people love, but you're showing them a version they've never seen before: Shaggy with depth, trauma, complexity.

That's a gift and a challenge. Don't try to impersonate cartoon Shaggy. Create a character who COULD BECOME cartoon Shaggy once he heals, once he finds his way back to loving mysteries, once he meets a talking dog who teaches him to be brave again.

YOUR MISSION CHECKLIST
Before You Film:
☐ Read both scenes 10+ times, marking every emotional shift
☐ Research Brooklyn teen accent/rhythm (YouTube, TikTok are your friends)
☐ Watch one episode each of: Stranger Things, Freaks and Geeks, Sex Education (study the tone)
☐ Practice the "forty texts" joke until it's genuinely funny
☐ Work on the dentist metaphor—it needs to sound spontaneous
☐ Rehearse Scene Two's monologue standing, sitting, pacing—find what works
☐ Identify the three most important emotional beats in each scene
☐ Practice varying your vocal pace—fast when nervous/excited, slower when hurt
☐ Find YOUR physical version of "loose-limbed and larky"
☐ Record yourself doing each scene three completely different ways
☐ Watch those recordings—be ruthless about what works and what doesn't
☐ Make sure you can say "Pad See Ew" with the specific pain it deserves
☐ Practice the silent beat when Daphne looks at you—don't rush it
☐ Work on the final question in Scene Two—it should sound genuinely lost
☐ Memorize the EMOTIONAL JOURNEY not the exact words
☐ Prepare your alternative takes for both scenes
☐ Get comfortable with the idea that you're playing real pain with real humor
☐ Remember: You're not auditioning to be perfect, you're auditioning to be INTERESTING
The Night Before:
☐ Run each scene once OUT LOUD (not in your head)
☐ Go to bed early—you need to be fresh
☐ Don't practice the morning of—trust your prep
The Day Of:
☐ Warm up your voice and body
☐ Do your moment before for each scene
☐ Remember: Shaggy's humor is his armor, his pain is his truth
☐ Trust that you know this character
☐ Take risks—safe is forgettable
FINAL WORD:

Shaggy's question—"What's the point of finding out the truth when all that lies on the other side is heartbreak and pain?"—is the question at the heart of this entire series. Your job is to make us FEEL that question in our bones. Make us understand why a kid who loves mysteries would walk away from them. Make us believe in both the humor and the hurt.

You've got this. Now go be the Shaggy that Netflix doesn't even know they're looking for until they see YOU do it.

Zoinks, let's solve this mystery. (Sorry, I had to.)

Patty's Audition Preparation Guide
"DIG" - Amy Poehler & Michael Schur Single-Camera Comedy
Here's the deal: Patty isn't just the "clumsy fish-out-of-water girl." She's your chance to show casting that you can make vulnerability feel like a superpower and turn disaster into pure comedy gold.
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Type: Half-Hour Single-Camera Sitcom (Think "Parks & Rec" meets "Ted Lasso")

Genre: Workplace Comedy with Heart

Tone & Style: This is Amy Poehler and Michael Schur territory—grounded, warm, character-driven comedy. Think optimistic but not saccharine. Real humans with real flaws in ridiculous situations. The humor comes from truth, not punchlines.

Comparable Projects: "Parks & Recreation," "The Good Place," "Ted Lasso," "Schitt's Creek"

Scene Context: Patty's first day on the job and she's already catastrophically failing at the most basic tasks. She's desperate to prove herself while simultaneously proving she's in way over her head.

Key Insight: This isn't broad physical comedy—it's specific, character-driven awkwardness. Patty's clumsiness comes from genuine nervousness and inexperience, not cartoon-level incompetence.
2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN
Who is Patty? (The Real Version)
Patty is what happens when boundless enthusiasm meets zero real-world experience. She's not stupid—she's sheltered. There's a difference. She approaches everything with the earnestness of someone who genuinely believes hard work and good intentions can overcome any obstacle. Spoiler alert: they can't, but her trying is what makes us love her.

How She Sees Herself:
A dedicated, hardworking assistant ready to tackle any challenge. She genuinely thinks her farm background has prepared her for anything. She's proud of her work ethic and convinced that if she just tries hard enough, she'll figure it out.

How Others See Her:
Clare sees a walking disaster. Neville sees a helpful tool he can deploy and forget about. Jessica sees a sweet kid who needs guidance. The world sees someone who apologizes for existing while accidentally destroying everything in her path.

Your Bridge to Patty (Find Your Connection):
Ever been the new kid who had no clue what they were doing?
Do you get nervous and overcompensate by talking too much?
Have you ever wanted to impress someone so badly you made it worse?
Are you fiercely loyal once someone shows you kindness?
Do you sometimes feel like everyone else got a manual for life?
The Empathy Stretch (What's Different About Her):
Her isolation level—she's literally never left her county
Her physical clumsiness is chronic, not situational
She has zero filter when nervous (which is always)
Her optimism borders on delusional
Character Shortcut: Patty is a golden retriever puppy in human form—enthusiastic, well-meaning, and absolutely guaranteed to knock over your coffee while trying to help.
3. UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (PATTY EDITION)
Who am I?
I'm a 19-year-old farm girl from rural Maine on my first-ever real job. I'm Professor Bratton's assistant, which makes me feel incredibly important and terrified in equal measure. I'm someone who's always been the helpful one at home, and I'm determined to be just as helpful here—even though I have no idea what "here" actually requires.

Where am I?
A sterile, intimidating laboratory that feels like a spaceship compared to the barn I'm used to working in. Everything here is expensive, breakable, and completely foreign to me. This is Clare's domain, and I'm very clearly trespassing.

What time is it?
Early morning on what's supposed to be my first productive day. I got here early because that's what good employees do, right? Except I've been standing in the dark like a creep because I was too scared to touch anything.

What surrounds me?
Expensive equipment I don't recognize, important-looking papers I can't read, and an overall atmosphere of scientific precision that makes my farm-girl sensibilities feel like a bull in a china shop. Everything here costs more than my family's tractor.

What are the relationships?
Clare is my new boss-adjacent-person who clearly thinks I'm an idiot. Professor Bratton is my actual boss who I desperately want to impress. Jessica is this magical older woman who seems to have all the answers I wish I had. Everyone else exists in this sophisticated world I'm trying to break into.

What are the circumstances?
I'm thousands of miles from home, completely out of my element, and already screwing up basic tasks. This job represents everything I've never had—sophistication, education, a future beyond the farm—and I'm blowing it spectacularly.

What do I want?
To prove I belong here. To show everyone (especially myself) that a farm girl can make it in the big leagues. Immediate goal: Get through one conversation without breaking something or saying something mortifying.

What's in my way?
My complete inexperience with everything that isn't farm-related. My nervous energy that makes me clumsy. The fact that everyone here operates on a level of sophistication I've only seen in movies. Also, my own mouth—it betrays me constantly.

How do I get what I want?
By being so enthusiastic and helpful that my incompetence becomes endearing rather than infuriating. If I can't be smooth, I'll be earnest. If I can't be sophisticated, I'll be genuine. I'm hoping my work ethic will eventually override my disaster quotient.

4. SCENE ACTION & PHYSICALITY
What Patty is Actually DOING:
Standing awkwardly: She's been frozen in place, afraid to move
Overcompensating socially: Desperate handshake attempts, verbal diarrhea
Trying to be helpful: Every movement toward a task becomes a disaster
Damage control: Trying to fix what she breaks while breaking more things
Information dumping: When nervous, she overshares personal details
Seeking approval: Watching for reactions, trying to read the room
Physical Comedy Gold Mine: The key is that each disaster happens because she's trying so hard to do the right thing. She knocks over the coffee cup because she's focused on looking professional while sitting. She knocks over the lamp because she's trying to clean up the first mess carefully.
The Clumsiness Strategy:
This isn't Three Stooges physical comedy. Each accident should feel like it could really happen to someone who's nervous and out of their element. Think about how your body behaves differently when you're anxious—you're either too careful (and stiff) or too enthusiastic (and reckless).

Vocal Physicality:
Patty's voice should do as much work as her body. When she's nervous, she talks faster. When she's trying to be professional, she might speak more carefully. When she's excited, everything pours out at once. Her Maine accent probably gets stronger when she's stressed.

Pro Tip: Find moments where her farm background actually IS helpful—maybe she's great at carrying heavy things or has incredible stamina. Show us glimpses of the competent person she is in her own environment.
5. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL LAYERS
What She's REALLY Saying:
"I didn't know if I was allowed to touch the light switch!" = I'm so out of my depth that even basic actions feel dangerous.
"Consider it done, boss." = Please like me. Please think I'm competent. I'm trying so hard.
"I actually do have an enlarged vestibular aqueduct." = See? I'm not just clumsy—there's a medical reason! I'm not stupid!
"I'm really grateful to be working here." = This is the biggest opportunity of my life and I'm terrified I'm going to lose it.
"You are the smartest person I've ever met." = Please keep talking. You're teaching me how to be a person in the real world.
The Emotional Journey:
Frozen Terror → Desperate Enthusiasm (meeting Clare)
Catastrophic Shame → Defensive Explanation (breaking things)
Hopeful Gratitude → Information Vomit (trying to connect)
Awe and Wonder → Eager Student (learning from Jessica)
Secret Weapon: Find the moments where Patty actually enjoys being the disaster. There's a part of her that finds her own chaos kind of fascinating—it makes for good stories, and she knows it.
The Poolside Transformation:
Notice how different Patty is with Jessica versus Clare. With Clare, she's apologetic and defensive. With Jessica, she's open and curious. Jessica treats her like a person worth knowing, and Patty blooms under that attention. Use that contrast.

6. MAKING PATTY UNFORGETTABLE
The Type (And How to Break It):
Yes, Patty's the "Fish Out of Water." But here's your twist: she's not helpless—she's inexperienced. There's a difference. She has real skills and real intelligence; they just don't translate to this environment. Yet.

Your Signature Touches:
Maine Sensibility: She approaches problems like a practical farm girl—direct, honest, resourceful
Oversharer's Delight: When nervous, she reveals way too much personal information
Physical Honesty: Her body language is completely readable—no filter between feeling and expression
Optimistic Realist: She sees disasters clearly but somehow maintains hope
Patty's Worldview: "The world is way more complicated than I thought, but if I keep showing up and trying my best, maybe I'll figure it out. Also, everyone here needs to eat more vegetables and get better sleep."
Why This Matters:
Casting isn't just looking for someone who can be awkward on cue. They want the actor who makes Patty feel like someone you'd actually want to protect and root for. Show them her heart, not just her disasters.

7. BOLD ACTING CHOICES
The Trap vs. The Truth:
The Trap: Playing Patty as just a walking disaster for five minutes straight.

The Truth: Patty's a competent person in the wrong environment who's trying desperately to adapt.

Surprising Shifts to Try:
Vocal Choice: When talking about her medical condition, shift into "knowledgeable patient" mode—she actually knows this stuff
Physical Surprise: After each disaster, she immediately shifts into "problem-solving mode"—she's used to cleaning up messes
Emotional Risk: What if there's a moment where she almost quits? Where the humiliation becomes too much before she rallies?
Status Play: With Jessica, let Patty become the confident storyteller—she knows she's good at stories
Comedy Strategy (This is CRUCIAL):
The funny comes from how seriously she takes everything. Every task is life-or-death important to her. Every social interaction could make or break her future. Commit 100% to the stakes she's created in her own mind.

Bold Choice Alert: What if Patty has a moment of genuine competence? Like when she's talking about farming or when she's comforting herself with practical wisdom? Show us the person she is when she's not drowning.
The Stuffed Animal Detail:
This is gold. She brought 12 stuffed animals instead of shirts. That's not random—that tells us everything about how she copes with stress and what she prioritizes for comfort. Make that detail land.

8. MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON
Your Moment Before (Scene 1):
You've been standing in this dark lab for who knows how long, afraid to touch anything. You've been giving yourself pep talks, practicing what you'll say when someone arrives, maybe even rehearsing how to sit on that stool professionally. You're wound up like a spring, ready to prove yourself.

Your Moment Before (Scene 2):
You just had the most enlightening conversation of your life. Jessica treated you like an equal, like someone worth knowing. You're probably still thinking about everything she said, trying to memorize it so you can apply it later.

The Button Options:
Scene 1: After the stuffed animal revelation, maybe you realize how ridiculous you sound and give a little self-aware laugh—"I'm a mess, aren't I?"

Scene 2: After the toilet bowl cleaner admission, you could have a moment of genuine pride—"Just part of life, right?"—where you're actually applying Jessica's wisdom in real time.

9. REHEARSAL GAME PLAN
Your 10+ Takes Strategy:
Take 1: Full disaster mode—let her be completely overwhelmed
Take 2: More determined—she's going to power through this
Take 3: Find the humor she sees in her own chaos
Take 4: What if she's more observant? She notices everything, just doesn't know how to process it
Take 5: Play with the contrast between scenes—confident with Jessica, nervous with Clare
Takes 6-10: Mix and match what worked, explore different physical approaches
Physical Rehearsal:
Practice the clumsiness until it feels natural. The coffee cup spill, the lamp knock-over—these need to look like genuine accidents, not choreographed gags. Work out the timing so you can focus on the emotional reality, not the mechanics.

Memorization Strategy: Focus on Patty's emotional journey rather than exact word order. She's someone who rambles when nervous, so if you drop a line or add one, stay in character and keep going. Patty would absolutely lose her train of thought and backtrack.
The Chemistry Factor:
Even with an off-camera reader, really listen and react. If Clare sounds annoyed, let that sting. If Jessica sounds warm, let that comfort you. Your reactions to their energy will show casting how you work with other actors.

YOUR ACTION PLAN
☐ Read both scenes 5+ times, marking every emotional shift
☐ Practice your nervous entrance—how does anxiety live in YOUR body?
☐ Work on the physical comedy until it feels natural, not rehearsed
☐ Find your version of Patty's oversharing tendency
☐ Practice the transition between scenes—scared Patty vs. awed Patty
☐ Nail the medical explanation—she knows this stuff, she's not making it up
☐ Work on the contrast between defensive explanations and genuine enthusiasm
☐ Practice staying present when things go wrong (in character or in real life)
☐ Remember: she's not stupid, she's inexperienced
☐ MOST IMPORTANT: Find what YOU love about Patty—that's what will make us love her too
Final Pep Talk: You're not auditioning to be the perfect Patty. You're auditioning to be YOUR version of Patty—the one only you can bring to life. Patty's not just comic relief; she's the heart of this show. She's the person we root for because she represents all of us when we're in over our heads but too determined to quit. Show them a Patty who makes mistakes but never gives up. Show them a Patty worth following on this journey. Now go prove that farm girls can do anything—even when they break half the lab in the process.

Foster Dade Audition Mastery
TV Pilot Drama • Series Regular • The Narrator Who Burns Down Everything
Holy shit, this changes everything. I just read the entire pilot, and now I see what we're really dealing with. Foster Dade isn't just another sensitive outsider—he's the unreliable narrator of his own downfall, documenting his transformation from victim to villain in real-time. This is your audition for the lead of what could be the next "Euphoria" or "Elite."
1. THE REAL PROJECT (Now That I've Seen It All)
What This Actually Is: A psychological thriller disguised as a boarding school drama. Think "The Secret History" meets "13 Reasons Why" with the visual sophistication of "Euphoria."

Genre: Dark Academia Psychological Drama

The Real Hook: We're watching someone become a monster while they think they're becoming the hero of their own story. Foster is Jay Gatsby if Nick Carraway were 15, addicted to pills, and completely self-deluded about his own moral superiority.

Comparable Projects: "Elite," "Euphoria," "The Secret History," "Dead Poets Society" (but darker), "Succession" (teen version)

Scene Context: Your audition scenes aren't just character moments—they're the DNA of the entire series. Scene 1 shows Foster as the blogger/chronicler. Scene 2 shows his first real rejection and moral compromise. But here's what's crucial: the full pilot reveals Foster is an UNRELIABLE NARRATOR whose "victimhood" is questionable.

The Game Changer: After reading the full pilot, I now see Foster isn't just a troubled teen. He's a master manipulator who tells himself he's the victim. Your audition needs to hint at this darker truth beneath the surface sensitivity. That's what will book you this role.
2. FOSTER DADE: THE COMPLETE TRUTH
Who Foster REALLY Is:
Foster is a brilliant kid who weaponizes his intelligence and sensitivity. He sees everything, understands people's weaknesses, and uses that knowledge to get what he wants—while convincing himself he's above it all. He's not just documenting the corruption around him; he's participating in it and justifying it through his blog.

The Fatal Flaw That Drives Everything:
Foster believes that understanding something intellectually means he has moral authority over it. He thinks his awareness of his own manipulation makes him more honest than everyone else. This delusion is what makes him both fascinating and dangerous.

What the Pilot Reveals About Your Scenes:
Scene 1 (The Blogger): Foster is curating his own narrative, choosing what to reveal and what to hide
Scene 2 (The Rejection): This isn't just heartbreak—it's the moment Foster learns how to use vulnerability as a weapon
The Tennis Court Moment: Foster's "defense" of Annabeth isn't chivalrous—it's him establishing his moral superiority while being just as judgmental
The Series Arc Hidden in Your Scenes: Foster thinks he's Holden Caulfield calling out the phonies. He's actually Tom Ripley learning how to blend in with them. Your audition needs to show both layers—the sensitive observer AND the calculating manipulator underneath.
Your Bridge to Foster:
Have you ever justified questionable behavior by telling yourself you had good intentions?
Do you sometimes use your emotional intelligence to get what you want?
Have you ever felt morally superior to people while doing the exact same things they do?
Are you good at reading people's weaknesses?
What Makes This Role MASSIVE:
Foster isn't just the protagonist—he's the narrator, the moral center, and the antagonist all rolled into one. He's carrying voice-over work, complex psychological layers, AND a complete character transformation over multiple seasons. This is the kind of role that launches careers.

3. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE
Foster's Internal Operating System:
Core Belief: "I see the world as it really is, which makes me more honest than everyone else."

Core Lie: "I'm different from these privileged kids because I understand how corrupt they are."

Core Truth: Foster wants to belong so desperately that he'll become the very thing he claims to despise, all while documenting it as a moral journey.

Foster's Arc Across the Pilot:
Episode Start: Sensitive outsider documenting the elite world he's entered

Middle: Gets seduced by acceptance, starts compromising his values

End: Becomes complicit in the very behavior he judges, while telling himself he's still morally superior

Series Arc: Will become the architect of the scandal that destroys Kennedy

What This Means for Your Audition:
Don't play Foster as just sensitive or just manipulative. Play him as someone who uses his sensitivity as his primary manipulation tool. His pain is real, but so is his calculation about how to use that pain to get what he wants.

The Audition Secret Weapon:
Foster thinks his self-awareness makes him the hero of his own story. Show us moments where his "honesty" is actually self-serving. When he calls out the tennis court women, he's not being brave—he's performing moral superiority. When he blogs about his experiences, he's not processing—he's controlling the narrative.

4. SCENE-BY-SCENE MASTERY
Scene 1: The Blogger (Your Narrator Introduction)
What's Really Happening:
Foster is introducing us to his world, but he's choosing what we see and how we see it. This isn't diary entry—this is PR. He's already decided he's the protagonist, and everything he tells us is filtered through that lens.

Key Acting Choices:
Voice-over tone: More controlled and performative than his dialogue voice
The self-medication line: He's not ashamed—he's intellectualizing his drug use as self-awareness
"Teenagers are basically sociopaths": He thinks this observation makes him different from other teenagers
V.O. Direction: Foster's blog voice should feel like a TED Talk given by a teenager who thinks he's figured out the world. Confident, slightly superior, but with undertones of the desperation we'll see in dialogue.
Scene 2: The Rejection (The Origin Story)
What's Really Happening:
This isn't just romantic rejection—it's Foster learning that vulnerability can be a manipulation tool. Watch how he processes Annabeth's explanation about her father. Instead of just being hurt, he's calculating how to use this information.

Key Acting Choices:
"What do you want from me": Genuine desperation, but also the moment Foster realizes his emotional displays have power
The weed scene with Jae: Foster isn't just self-medicating—he's choosing to become someone else
"Tell your dad you asked me for the favor": This is Foster's first real manipulation, disguised as integrity
The Tennis Court Power Play:
This scene is EVERYTHING. Foster isn't defending Annabeth out of pure chivalry—he's establishing his moral superiority while being just as vicious as the women he's attacking. The real Foster is revealed in how much he enjoys destroying these women verbally.

"In what moral universe do you get to pass comment on anyone's life?"
Foster, you're literally doing exactly that in your blog. The irony is the point.
5. THE VOICE-OVER MASTERCLASS
Foster Has Two Distinct Voices:
Blog Voice (V.O.): Controlled, analytical, performative. This is Foster as curator of his own story.

Dialogue Voice: More reactive, vulnerable, desperate. This is Foster when he can't control the narrative.

The V.O. Strategy:
Foster's voice-overs aren't just exposition—they're unreliable narration. He's telling us his version of events, which may not match reality. Practice delivering these lines like you're giving a presentation about your own life to an audience you need to convince.

Series Regular Reality: Your voice-over work will carry entire episodes. Casting needs to believe you can be compelling reading a grocery list. Foster's internal monologue needs to be so magnetic that we could watch him think for 45 minutes and be entertained.
Voice-Over Acting Beats:
"Every journal entry I've read starts with the writer describing themselves": Slightly superior, like he's above this cliché while participating in it
"Teenagers are basically sociopaths": Delivered like he's discovered something profound
"I should try a healthier outlet": The slight irony that he knows this is performative
6. THE SERIES REGULAR MINDSET
What Casting is Really Looking For:
Can you carry a show on your voice-over alone?
Can you make a morally questionable character sympathetic without excusing his behavior?
Can you show the complexity of someone who's both victim and victimizer?
Do you have the charisma to make us want to follow this character even when he's making terrible choices?
The Foster Dade Challenge:
This character requires you to play multiple layers simultaneously. Foster is sensitive AND manipulative, insightful AND self-deluded, victimized AND victimizing. Most actors can play one or the other. Series regulars can play all of them at once.

Your Secret Weapon:
Foster's greatest strength is also his fatal flaw: he thinks being self-aware about his manipulation makes him more honest than everyone else. Show us a character who genuinely believes his own BS while we can see through it. That's the level of complexity that books series regular roles.

Physical Choices That Matter:
The typing scenes: Foster at his laptop isn't just writing—he's crafting his mythology
Tennis court physicality: His "grace" is performed—he's showing off, not just playing
The confrontation with Mrs. Brenner: Foster enjoys this moment of power disguised as moral outrage
7. BOLD CHOICES THAT LAUNCH CAREERS
The Choice Nobody Expects:
What if Foster is actually enjoying parts of his moral compromise? What if there's a moment where he realizes he's becoming the very thing he came to study, and part of him is thrilled by it? Show us the seduction of corruption, not just the tragedy of it.

Risky Choices That Pay Off:
Vocal Surprise: What if Foster's voice-over has a slight smile in it? He enjoys being the narrator of his own destruction
Physical Contradiction: Foster moves with more confidence than his words suggest—his body knows he's performing
Emotional Complexity: Don't just play the hurt—play Foster's fascination with his own pain
The Moment That Books the Job:
It's not the big emotional moments that will get you this role—it's the micro-moments where we see Foster calculating behind his vulnerability. Maybe it's a tiny pause before he says something "honest." Maybe it's the way his eyes work when someone reveals something personal. Show us the wheels turning.

Industry Truth: They're not just casting an actor—they're casting the face of a potentially massive streaming series. Foster Dade could run for 4+ seasons. Every choice you make needs to suggest depth that can sustain that journey. Show them a character they can't stop exploring.
8. MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON MASTERY
Your Moment Before - Scene 1:
You've just finished reading something that made you realize how much material your Kennedy experience is giving you. You sit down to write, knowing this entry will establish you as the chronicler of this world. You're excited about your role as observer and narrator.

Your Moment Before - Scene 2:
You've been thinking about Annabeth all day. You approach with hope, terror, and a calculation about how to position yourself as different from Jack and his crowd. You think your sensitivity will be your secret weapon.

The Button (Your Career Moment):
After Foster's final voice-over about longing, give us a moment where he chooses his next move. Maybe there's a small smile—Foster realizes he's found his angle. Maybe he opens his laptop to write. Show us the moment Foster decides to become the author of his own myth.

"These are the things I long for."
But Foster, what happens when you get them through manipulation?
9. REHEARSAL STRATEGY FOR SERIES REGULAR SUCCESS
Your 15+ Takes Approach:
Takes 1-3: Play Foster's intelligence and sensitivity—make us fall in love with him
Takes 4-6: Find his calculating edge—the part that will eventually destroy everyone
Takes 7-9: Explore his self-deception—Foster who believes his own narrative
Takes 10-12: Play the unreliable narrator angle—what is he NOT telling us?
Takes 13-15: Blend everything—sensitive manipulator who thinks he's the hero
Voice-Over vs. Dialogue Mastery:
Practice switching between Foster's controlled blog voice and his more reactive dialogue voice seamlessly. The V.O. is Foster performing his own story. The dialogue is Foster when the performance breaks down.

Memorization Strategy for Unreliable Narrators: Don't memorize Foster's words as truth—memorize them as his VERSION of truth. Every line is a choice about what to reveal, what to hide, and how to position himself. That awareness will change everything about your delivery.
The Alternative Take (Callback Gold):
If they ask for something different, try "Foster with more conscious awareness of his own manipulation." Instead of being unconsciously calculating, what if he knows exactly what he's doing and enjoys it? Same lines, completely different energy—and it shows you understand the character's full arc.

YOUR SERIES REGULAR BATTLE PLAN
☐ Read the audition scenes 20+ times, noting every layer of truth and deception
☐ Practice voice-over work—make it sound like a TED Talk about your own life
☐ Master the two Foster voices: controlled narrator vs. reactive teenager
☐ Work on the tennis court scene—find Foster's enjoyment of his own moral superiority
☐ Rehearse the transition between scenes—different energy, same calculating core
☐ Find Foster's physicality—intellectual confidence masking emotional desperation
☐ Practice the rejection scene—let us see him learning to weaponize vulnerability
☐ Record yourself and ask: "Would I want to watch this character for 4+ seasons?"
☐ Prepare that alternative take (Foster with conscious manipulation awareness)
☐ Remember: You're not just playing a character—you're auditioning to BE a show
The Real Talk: After reading the full pilot, I'm convinced Foster Dade is the kind of role that defines a career. This isn't just another troubled teen—this is Tom Ripley at boarding school, Jay Gatsby with a blog, Walter White if he started manipulating people at 15. You're auditioning to play one of the most psychologically complex characters on television. Show them a Foster who's brilliant, sensitive, calculating, and completely self-deluded about his own moral superiority. Give them a character so compelling they can't imagine the show without you. Because that's exactly what this role demands.

Juniper's Audition Preparation Guide
"13 Folds" - Feature Film Drama
Here's the truth: Juniper isn't the girl who announces herself when she walks into a room.
She's the one you realize you've been watching the entire time.
Your job? Make casting forget they're watching an audition.
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Type: Feature Film (Independent Drama)

Genre: Coming-of-age drama with spiritual undertones

Tone & Style: This is NOT a Disney Channel movie. This is quiet, observational, poetic cinema. Think soft focus on hard truths. The performances need to feel like documentary footage of real teenagers living real lives—no theatrical "acting," no melodrama, no performed emotion. Everything is earned. Everything is felt.

Comparable Projects: The Tree of Life (Terrence Malick), Moonlight, Eighth Grade, early episodes of Friday Night Lights, Wildlife with Carey Mulligan

Visual Language: Golden hour light. Long silences. Voiceover that acts as poetry, not exposition. The camera lingers. Your face will tell more story than your words ever could.

Scene Context: Juniper enters Tucker's world slowly, persistently, gently—like water finding cracks in stone. These scenes span weeks, maybe months. We're watching the beginning of something neither of them fully understands yet. A boy grieving his father. A girl escaping hers. Two people learning what it means to carry something together.

Director's Vision Alert: This script was written with extreme intentionality. Every pause matters. Every repeated phrase ("TuckerTolly," the book, the tree) is a motif, not an accident. Your performance needs to honor that poetry without PLAYING poetry. Stay grounded. Stay human. Let the beauty happen around you, not through you performing it.
2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN
Who is Juniper Jamieson? (The Real Version)
Juniper is a 14-year-old girl who has learned to make herself small so she doesn't take up space her father might need for his rage. She's learned that love and pain can live in the same hand. She's learned that mothers leave, fathers forget, and if you want anything resembling safety, you build it yourself.

But here's the miracle: she hasn't hardened. She hasn't turned mean or cynical or cold. Instead, she's become soft—dangerously soft—in a world that punishes softness. She still believes in signs. She still draws trees in books. She still shows up at Tucker's door every single morning, crooked grin steady, offering him a reason to keep walking forward.

Juniper is not a victim. She's a survivor who refuses to survive ugly.

How She Sees Herself:
As someone who doesn't quite belong anywhere. Not at home (where her dad is either absent or drunk). Not at school (we never see her there with other friends). She exists in the in-between—the walk to and from school, the crack in Tucker's armor, the space between what is and what could be. She sees herself as the girl carrying the heavy book, hoping someone will offer to help.

How Tucker Sees Her:
As someone who "just steps into your life like they've got the spare key." She terrifies him because she sees him—really sees him—and doesn't look away. She's patient where the world has been demanding. She's present where everyone else has left. She's the opposite of grief: she's hope with braided hair and orange painted sneakers.

How the WORLD Sees Her:
Probably doesn't. That's the tragedy and the power. She's invisible until she decides to be seen. And when she is? She's unforgettable.

Your Bridge to Juniper (Find Your Connection):
Have you ever loved someone who was too broken to love you back properly?
Have you ever had to parent yourself because the adults were too lost?
Do you know what it's like to make yourself small so you don't upset someone?
Have you ever stayed loyal to someone even when it hurt?
Do you believe in signs? In trees? In the idea that love can be quiet and still be real?
The Empathy Stretch (What's Different About Her):
You probably have more stability at home than Juniper does
You might not understand what it's like to have a parent who forgets you exist
You may not have had to develop her level of emotional self-sufficiency at 14
Her stillness isn't shyness—it's survival strategy. Learn the difference.
Character Reference Shortcut: Think early Carey Mulligan in An Education—a girl with an old soul who sees the world clearly but still chooses kindness. Or Kaitlyn Dever in Short Term 12—that specific brand of wounded but not broken. Juniper is grace under pressure. She's a dogwood tree in a storm: she bends, but she doesn't snap.
3. UTA HAGEN'S 9 QUESTIONS (Juniper Edition)
Who am I?
I'm a girl who learned early that people leave. My mom left when I was eight—just gone, no explanation good enough to fill that hole. My dad stayed, but only in body. His mind checks out every time he opens a bottle. I've been raising myself since third grade. I do my own laundry. I make my own meals. I forge his signature on permission slips. I know which nights to stay at a friend's house (when he works the late shift at the refinery and comes home already drunk). I know which bruises to cover and which lies to tell.

But I also know that trees grow even in drought. I know that some boys carry books without being asked. I know that Tucker Tolly kisses his mom goodbye and that makes him different. That makes him safe. And I've decided—quietly, carefully—that I'm going to make him see me. Not because I need saving. Because I think maybe we can save each other.

Where am I?
Scene 1: Tucker's front door. This is sacred ground. This house has a mother who makes lunches "like armor." This house smells like fabric softener and routine. I want to live here. I want to belong here. So I keep showing up.

Scene 2: The high school parking lot. Exposed. Public. This is me making my move—crooked grin, heavy book, zero shame. If I'm going to make Tucker notice me, it has to be out in the open where he can't hide.

Scene 3-5: The walk home. This is our world now. Cracked sidewalks, chain-link fences, the white church on the corner. These streets know my secrets. They've seen my dad's car weaving. They've seen me walk home alone a thousand times. But now I'm not alone. Now I have Tucker. And that changes everything.

What time is it?
Early fall. First weeks of high school. The time of day when the light turns everything gold and you can almost believe the world is kind. These are the afternoons that feel like they could last forever—before homework, before dinner, before my dad comes home and the air turns heavy. Right now, in this moment, I get to be a girl walking home with a boy who carries my book. Right now, I'm normal. I'm safe. I'm seen.

What surrounds me?
Stillwater, Oklahoma. A town small enough that everyone knows everyone's business, which means everyone knows my mom left and my dad drinks. The church bells ring every hour. The high school stadium lights flicker on at dusk for football practice. Pickup trucks and poverty and prayer—that's Stillwater. It's not cruel, just indifferent. And I've learned to find beauty in the cracks: the way sprinklers catch light, the stained glass scattering colors on concrete, the sound of Tucker's voice when he almost smiles.

What are the relationships?
Tucker: He's my project and my person. I see his grief like I see my own loneliness—we're both orphans in different ways. I'm teaching him it's okay to let someone in. He's teaching me it's okay to ask for help (even if I have to trick him with a heavy book).

Mom Tolly: She's everything I wish I had. Warm. Present. Protective. When she teases Tucker about "his friend," I want to correct her: I'm not just his friend. I'm going to be more. I'm going to be the person who stays.

My Dad: I love him and I hate him and I'm terrified of him and I'm worried about him. All at the same time. All the time. When he yells, I know it's the alcohol. When he forgets me, I know it's the grief. But knowing doesn't make it hurt less. I tell Tucker "it was just an accident" because I need to believe it. Because if it wasn't an accident, then what does that make me?

What are the circumstances?
I'm in survival mode pretending to be a normal teenager. My dad got arrested (DUI, not his first). I spent the night with a stranger from Social Services who smelled like menthol cigarettes and pity. I came to school the next day with a bruise on my cheek and a story about reaching for the radio. I've learned that if you smile when you lie, people believe you. I've learned that boys like Tucker will carry your books if you let them feel needed. I've learned that love doesn't look like the movies—it looks like showing up every single morning, even when you don't have to.

What do I want?
Immediate goal: Make Tucker see me. Not as the weird girl who won't go away. As someone worth choosing. Someone worth keeping.

Deeper want: To belong to something that doesn't leave. A person, a place, a promise that stays. I want what Tucker has—a mom who worries, a routine that holds, a home that feels like home. And if I can't have that for myself, maybe I can borrow his. Maybe if I make myself essential to his story, I get to be part of something good.

Deepest want (the one I barely admit to myself): I want to stop carrying everything alone. I want someone to see the bruises I hide and the fear I swallow and the exhaustion I wear like a second skin. I want Tucker to look at me and say, "I've got you." And mean it.

What's in my way?
Tucker's grief. He's so lost in missing his dad that he can't see I'm right here, ready to be found. His mom's protectiveness (she knows I'm trouble, even if she's too kind to say it). My dad's drinking (any day he could get worse, could hurt me for real, could make me disappear the way my mom did). The world's indifference (nobody's coming to save me, so I have to save myself). And my own fear that even if Tucker does choose me, even if he does see me—what happens when he realizes I'm not worth the trouble?

How do I get what I want?
Patience. Persistence. Presence. I show up every morning with my crooked grin and my heavy book. I make myself useful (he gets to feel like a gentleman). I make myself interesting (trees, drawings, metaphors that make him think). I don't rush him. I don't demand. I just... exist beside him until the space between us feels smaller. Until walking home without me feels wrong. Until the idea of me not being there is worse than the fear of letting me in.

And when he finally asks if I'm his girlfriend? I don't make it easy. I make him say it. I make him choose it. Because I need to know he means it.

4. SCENE-BY-SCENE BREAKDOWN
SCENE ONE: The Front Door
What I'm Physically Doing:

Standing in the doorway (threshold = symbolic, I'm asking permission to enter his world)
Balancing the book on my knees while I pet Meatball (grounding action, shows comfort with animals/innocence)
Lifting the book like an offering when I mention the Simpsons reference
Kneeling (making myself smaller, non-threatening)
Beaming when his mom suggests tomorrow (hope is my superpower)
Subtext Under the Lines:

"Is Tucker Tolly home?" = I know he's avoiding me. I'm giving him an out. But I'm not leaving.
"I brought a book this time." = I'm learning. I'm adapting. I'm making this easier for him.
"That's how Marge got Homer." = I'm telling you my strategy. I'm not hiding that I'm pursuing him. I'm bold enough to be honest about what I want.
"I can wait. I don't mind." = I have nowhere else to be. This is the best part of my day. You're the best part of my day.
Physicality Note: You're working with a DOG in this scene. Use Meatball. Let yourself get lost in petting him—it shows your capacity for tenderness, for connection, for finding joy in small moments. When you kneel, your body language should read as OPEN, not desperate. You're not begging. You're inviting. There's a difference.
SCENE TWO: "Is It Heavy?"
What I'm Physically Doing:

Walking across the parking lot (alone, carrying my big book, visible to everyone)
Stopping when he calls out (heart leap, don't show it too much)
Turning to face him (this is the moment I've been waiting for)
Playing dumb about the book's weight (testing him, flirting)
Catching on to his game and matching his energy (oh, we're doing THIS now? Okay.)
Realizing I'm about to win and leaning into the bit
Subtext:

"What?" = Make me spell it out. Make this mean something.
"Of course not... it's paper, not lead." = I'm not going to make this easy for you. You have to actually TRY.
"It's heavy! REALLY heavy!" = Okay, you tried. I'll meet you halfway. Let's do this dance.
The Comedy Here: This is a COURTSHIP RITUAL disguised as a conversation about a book. It's flirty without being cloying. It's playful without being childish. You're testing each other. He's offering to help. You're making him work for it. By the end, you're both smiling. That's the magic. Don't rush it. Let the pauses breathe. Let us see you falling for him in real time.
SCENE THREE: The First Walk
What I'm Physically Doing:

Walking steady at his side (matching his pace, not ahead, not behind—equal)
Glancing at him when he's quiet (studying him, learning him)
Noticing his shoes, his body language, the way he holds my book
Tilting my head when I speak (curiosity, openness, invitation)
Smiling small when he says something real (rewarding his honesty)
Looking back when I dare him to follow (playful confidence, I know he will)
Taking off ahead (testing him: will you chase me?)
Subtext:

"You always this quiet after school?" = I want to know you. All of you. Even the quiet parts.
"Maybe you just save it all up for later." = I see you. I see that you're more than this silence.
"Most boys would've just let me carry it myself." = You're different. That's why I chose you.
"That's my whole brain you're holdin' there." = I'm trusting you with something precious. Don't drop it.
"Maybe you were meant to carry it." = This isn't random. This is fate. We're supposed to find each other.
"Thanks for not makin' me carry it alone." = I've been alone for so long. Thank you for changing that.
Tucker's V.O. you need to FEEL:
"Sometimes I guess you don't know the weight you've been draggin'... 'til somebody lets you hold somethin' that ain't yours. And suddenly... yours just don't feel so heavy anymore."

That's what you're doing for him. You're giving him something to carry that's lighter than his grief. That's the gift. That's the love.
SCENE FOUR: The Kiss
What I'm Physically Doing:

Giving him a kiss on the front porch (brave, public, claiming him)
Waiting for him by the wrestling room (patience, loyalty)
Sitting cross-legged on the curb (grounded, at home in uncomfortable places)
Drawing the tree with my Sharpie (creating beauty, offering metaphor)
Showing him the drawing (vulnerability: this is how I see us)
Standing when he crouches (mirroring, connection)
Taking my book back (but letting him carry it again immediately—the ritual continues)
Subtext:

"Did he though? Is that really who he let in. Your girlfriend?" = Say it. Out loud. Make it real.
[The kiss] = I choose you. I choose you. I choose you.
"You know what trees do? They hold on." = I'm telling you I'm not leaving. Even when it's hard. Even when you push me away. I'm a tree. I'm staying.
"It's where I'd go if the world felt too loud." = I'm giving you my safe place. I'm letting you in.
The Kiss: This is not a Disney Channel peck. This is a 14-year-old girl claiming her person. It's quick, repeated (peck, peck, peck), giggling, nervous, joyful, REAL. Don't perform it. LIVE it. If you've never had a first kiss, imagine the best moment of your life and put that feeling in your body. That's what this is for Juniper.
SCENE FIVE: The Confession
What I'm Physically Doing:

Walking beside him in silence (letting him lead the conversation)
Eyes flicking away when he mentions the police (shame, even though it's not my fault)
Tracing the chain-link fence (nervous gesture, grounding)
Shrugging off the weight of my words (performing casualness to survive the pain)
Adjusting my braid (self-soothing, buying time)
Looking at him when I say "girlfriend" (testing: does this scare you? Are you going to leave now?)
Subtext:

"It's really no big deal." = It's a huge deal. But if I say that, I'll break. So I'm lying to both of us.
"I just think he forgets sometimes." = I'm making excuses for him because I need to believe he's still in there somewhere.
"She left when I was eight." = I'm telling you the worst thing that ever happened to me. Please don't flinch.
"The bruise... it was just an accident." = I need you to believe this lie so I can keep believing it.
"He'd never hurt me on purpose." = If I admit he would, then what? Where do I go? Who protects me?
CRITICAL ACTING NOTE: When Juniper talks about her dad's abuse, she MINIMIZES. She explains. She justifies. This is textbook trauma response. Your job is NOT to play "sad abuse victim." Your job is to play a girl who has convinced herself she's fine. The tragedy isn't in what she says—it's in how hard she's working to make it sound normal. THAT'S what will break the audience's heart.
5. PHYSICALITY & MOVEMENT
Juniper's Body Language:
Juniper moves like water—fluid, adaptable, always finding the path of least resistance. She doesn't storm or stomp. She doesn't demand space. She EARNS it.

Key Physical Traits:

Head tilts: Curiosity, invitation, active listening
Crooked grin: Her signature. It's not perfect—it's REAL. Practice in the mirror until you find a smile that feels lived-in.
Braids swaying: Constant gentle movement, even when she's still
Kneeling/crouching: She makes herself smaller, non-threatening, approachable
Eye contact: Direct but not aggressive. She SEES people. That's her power.
Stillness: When Tucker talks, she goes QUIET. Not fidgety. Not performing. Just... present.
The Walk:
Juniper doesn't rush. She's learned that good things come to those who wait (and show up consistently). Her walk should feel like she's in no hurry because she knows where she's going. Tucker might be the one carrying the book, but Juniper is leading the journey.

Orange Painted Sneakers:
If you can, incorporate this detail. It tells us everything: she's creative, resourceful, makes beauty out of what she has. She doesn't wait for the world to give her things—she makes them herself.

Physicality Secret Weapon: Juniper has learned to read people's bodies because her survival depends on it. She watches her dad for signs he's about to blow. She watches Tucker for signs he's softening. USE THIS. When you're in scene, your eyes should be constantly tracking micro-expressions, shifts in energy, changes in breathing. You're a student of human behavior because you've had to be.
6. VOICE & SPEECH
Vocal Qualities:
Soft but clear: She doesn't shout. She doesn't need to. People lean in to hear her.
Oklahoma accent (subtle): Don't go full country. Think more "plains states" than "Southern drawl." Words like "gonna" and "ain't" and "sorta" are natural, not performed.
Pauses: Juniper thinks before she speaks. She's deliberate. She chooses her words.
Moments of lightness: When she's flirting or playful, her voice lifts. When she's confessing trauma, it flattens—self-protection.
Speech Patterns:
She's not verbose. She's efficient. She says what needs saying and nothing more.
She uses metaphor naturally (the tree, the book, "roots dig down deeper")
When she's lying about her dad, her sentences get longer—overexplaining is a tell
Vocal Risk: What if during the "She left when I was eight" moment, Juniper's voice doesn't break—it goes FLAT. Emotionless. Like she's said it so many times it's lost meaning. That deadness might be more devastating than tears. Try both in rehearsal. See which one guts you more.
7. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL LAYERS
What's Under EVERY Line:
Juniper is always playing two levels simultaneously:

Surface: What she says (cheerful, helpful, undemanding)
Underneath: What she needs (safety, love, someone to stay)
Your job is to let us see BOTH. Not by telegraphing or indicating—but by living in the tension between the two.

Key Emotional Shifts:
Scene 1 → Scene 2: Hope → Cautious Victory
She's been showing up for days/weeks. Finally, FINALLY, Tucker responds. Don't waste this. Show us the relief, the joy, the "oh my god, it's working" of it all.

Scene 2 → Scene 3: Flirtation → Intimacy
The book joke is funny. The walk is REAL. We cross from "will they?" to "they are." Mark that transition.

Scene 3 → Scene 4: Connection → Commitment
The kiss changes everything. Before: she's pursuing him. After: they're choosing each other. That's HUGE.

Scene 4 → Scene 5: Joy → Vulnerability
Right after the high of "girlfriend," we crash into "my dad got arrested." Whiplash is intentional. Life doesn't stop being hard just because you found love.

Listen to Tucker's V.O. about you:
"And then there's the people... some who just step into your life like they've got the spare key. And the scariest part isn't ever that they walk right in. It's how a tiny bit of you... well, it just kinda wants 'em to."

That's YOUR character description. You have the spare key. You walk right in. You make yourself essential. That's your superpower.
8. THE TREE METAPHOR (Your Thematic Anchor)
The tree isn't just a drawing. It's EVERYTHING this movie is about. It's Tucker's grief (his dad planted a tree that died). It's Juniper's hope (trees hold on even in storms). It's their relationship (roots digging deep so the top can keep growing).

When you draw the tree, you're:

Offering Tucker a visual language for his pain
Showing him you understand what he's lost
Promising him that growth is still possible
Giving him a place to belong (roots = you got somethin' to belong to)
This moment should feel SACRED. Not performed-sacred. Actually-sacred. You're giving him a piece of your soul. Treat it that way.

Director's Note: The tree drawing will likely be a CLOSE-UP insert shot. That means your FACE while you show him the tree is just as important as the drawing itself. We need to see: pride, vulnerability, hope, fear of rejection, quiet certainty. All of it. In stillness.
9. MAKING JUNIPER UNFORGETTABLE
The Type (And How to Transcend It):
The Trap: "Damaged girl with absent mother and alcoholic father"
The Cliché: Playing her as weak, pitiful, broken, waiting to be saved

The Truth: Juniper is the STRONGEST person in this script. She's surviving circumstances that would destroy most adults. She's choosing kindness when the world has given her every excuse to be cruel. She's showing up for Tucker when she has every reason to protect herself. THAT is strength. THAT is what makes her a hero.

What Makes YOUR Juniper Different:
Your specific crooked grin: Find one that's yours
How you touch people: Are you tentative? Bold? Healing?
Your relationship to silence: Some people fill it. You inhabit it.
Your eyes: Casting said they want someone whose stillness is a superpower. Your eyes have to do the talking when your mouth stays closed.
Character Mantra: "I am not broken. I am not a burden. I am not a tragedy. I am a girl who chooses love even when love has failed me. I am a dogwood tree in a storm: I bend, but I do not break. I am Juniper Jamieson, and I will not be forgotten."
10. BOLD ACTING CHOICES THAT BOOK ROLES
The Danger Zone:
Playing Juniper as JUST sweet, JUST soft, JUST gentle = forgettable. Thousands of actresses can do "nice girl." You need to find the STEEL underneath the silk.

Surprising Shifts to Try:
Choice #1: The Laugh
What if when Tucker asks "Is it heavy?" and you say "Of course not... it's paper, not lead"—what if you LAUGH at him? Not mean. Just genuinely amused that he's being so transparent. It shows confidence. It shows you're not desperate. It shows you're PLAYING with him, not performing for him.

Choice #2: The Anger
When your dad pulls up drunk and yells at you—what if there's a FLASH of rage in your eyes before you put the mask back on? Just one second where we see: she's furious. She's humiliated. She hates him in this moment. Then she swallows it and says "It's just my dad" in that dead voice. The contrast will KILL.

Choice #3: The Certainty
When you say "Maybe you were meant to carry it" about the book—what if that line has WEIGHT? What if you believe in fate, in signs, in the universe putting people in each other's paths? Let that spiritual certainty come through. It adds dimension.

Choice #4: The Fear
After you kiss Tucker and claim him as your boyfriend—what if there's a moment where you FREEZE? Like, "Oh god, what did I just do? What if he leaves now that he knows how much I need him?" Let us see the vulnerability AFTER the brave choice. That's real.

The Audition Trap: Do NOT play the scenes in order emotionally. Scene 5 (the trauma confession) is not the "big emotional scene." Scene 4 (the kiss, the tree, the claiming of love) is just as high-stakes. If you only bring intensity to the "sad" scenes, you're telling casting you don't understand the character. Juniper's JOY is just as powerful as her pain. Maybe more so.
11. MOMENT BEFORE & BUTTON
Your Moment Before (Scene-Specific):
Scene 1 (Front Door):
You woke up extra early. You picked out your best outfit (which isn't much, but you tried). You practiced your smile in the mirror. You gave yourself a pep talk: "Today's the day he says yes." You've been standing on this porch for 30 seconds, gathering courage, before you ring the bell. When the door opens, you're READY. This is your Super Bowl.

Scene 2 (Parking Lot):
You saw him across the lot and your heart JUMPED. You almost chickened out. But then you thought about how he didn't come to the door this morning, and something in you said: "Nope. Not giving up." So you committed to crossing that parking lot, book in hand, bet placed. No turning back now.

Scene 4 (The Kiss):
You've been thinking about kissing him for WEEKS. You played it out in your head a hundred times. But hearing him say "Yeah... my girlfriend" out loud made it REAL. And real is terrifying. And real is everything you've ever wanted. So you stop thinking and you just... do it. Before you can talk yourself out of it.

Scene 5 (The Confession):
You've been carrying this secret alone for so long. And now you have someone who might actually CARE. Someone who saw the police lights and didn't look away. Part of you wants to lie (safer). Part of you is desperate to tell the truth (finally). You choose truth. Because maybe, just maybe, Tucker won't leave.

The Button (Your Secret Weapon):
Scene 1: After Mom Tolly says "try tomorrow," you could add a little wave to Meatball as you leave—showing you're not defeated, just patient.

Scene 3: After Tucker chases you and the V.O. ends, you could look back at him one more time—checking he's still there, still following. A smile that says "yeah, I knew you would."

Scene 4: After you kiss him, you could rest your forehead against his for just a beat—sealing it, making it sacred.

Scene 5: After you finish explaining about your dad, there could be a moment where you wait—breath held—to see if Tucker runs. When he doesn't, EXHALE. Relief. Gratitude. Maybe even the beginning of tears you won't let fall.

12. REHEARSAL GAME PLAN
Your 10+ Takes Strategy:
Take 1: Play her at full hope—optimistic, light, almost naive
Take 2: Add the undercurrent of fear—what if he rejects me?
Take 3: Find the moments where she's manipulating (the book, the lies about her dad) and OWN them
Take 4: Make it smaller—what if she's exhausted from pretending to be okay?
Take 5: Play the COMEDY in scenes 2-3 (this is a romantic comedy in a drama)
Take 6: Play her as OLDER than 14—world-weary, seen too much
Take 7: Play her as YOUNGER—14 going on 12, still a kid underneath it all
Take 8: Focus on physicality—the braids, the grin, the way she inhabits space
Take 9: Make every pause longer—let the silences BREATHE
Take 10+: Mix and match what worked, trust your instincts, surprise yourself

Your Alternative Take (The Callback Gold):
If they ask for "something different," try this: Play Juniper as someone who KNOWS she's being manipulative and doesn't apologize for it. She's strategic. She's playing chess. The book, the showing up every day, the carefully timed vulnerability—it's all calculated. Not in a villainous way. In a "I know what I want and I'm going to get it" way. This makes her MORE interesting, not less sympathetic. We respect people who go after what they want.

Memorization Hack for This Script: Don't memorize line-by-line. Memorize IMAGES. The book. The tree. The police lights. The church. The kiss. Let the images guide you through the emotional journey. The words will follow. This script is VISUAL—your performance should be too.
Self-Tape Specific Notes:
Frame: Medium close-up. We need to see your eyes, your braids, your hands when you show the tree drawing.
Lighting: Natural, golden hour if possible. This script LIVES in that light.
Background: Neutral, slightly out of focus. Nothing that distracts from your face.
Eye-line: Your reader should be JUST off-camera. When you look at "Tucker," we should see your eyes track to a real person.
Pacing: This is a SLOW script. Don't rush. Let the pauses land. Trust the silence.
13. SAFETY & EMOTIONAL PREPARATION
This role requires you to access real pain—abandonment, abuse, fear, loneliness. Before you do that work, let's talk about how to do it SAFELY.

Before You Rehearse:
Set a timer. Give yourself permission to step OUT of Juniper's world when the work is done.
Have a "return to self" ritual: wash your face, change clothes, listen to happy music.
Talk to a parent/guardian about the material. Make sure you have support.
During Rehearsal:
If you start to feel overwhelmed, STOP. Take a break. Trauma isn't something to method-act your way through.
Remember: You are NOT Juniper. You are an actress PLAYING Juniper. There's a difference.
Use the Adler technique: imagination, not personal memory. Create Juniper's pain from your imagination, not from your own trauma.
After the Audition/Shoot:
Give yourself time to decompress. This is heavy material.
Do something that makes you feel like YOU: dance, draw, call a friend.
Celebrate that you were brave enough to go there. Not everyone can.
A Note from Your Coach: Playing characters who experience abuse is IMPORTANT work. It gives voice to people who often don't have one. But it's also HARD work. Please take care of yourself. Your mental health is more important than any audition. If this material is triggering for you personally, it's okay to pass. There will be other roles. You matter more than the job.
YOUR ACTION PLAN
WEEK BEFORE AUDITION:

☐ Read the sides 10+ times—once out loud each time
☐ Watch An Education (Carey Mulligan) and Short Term 12 (Kaitlyn Dever) for character reference
☐ Practice your "crooked grin" in the mirror until it feels natural
☐ Work on subtle Oklahoma accent (listen to YouTube examples, keep it LIGHT)
☐ Rehearse the tree drawing moment—actually draw a tree, see how it feels
☐ Map out Juniper's emotional journey: hope → flirtation → love → fear → vulnerability
DAY BEFORE AUDITION:

☐ Do a full run-through with a reader (parent/friend/coach)
☐ Try the alternative take (strategic Juniper vs. innocent Juniper)
☐ Pick your outfit: simple, lived-in, something Juniper would actually wear
☐ Practice your moment-before for each scene
☐ Review Uta Hagen's 9 Questions—know them cold
DAY OF AUDITION:

☐ Warm up your voice and body—gentle stretches, vocal slides
☐ Do a "Juniper meditation": close your eyes, imagine her life, step into her shoes
☐ Review your bold choices one more time
☐ Remember: stillness is your superpower
☐ TRUST YOURSELF. You've done the work. Now just BE.
AFTER AUDITION:

☐ Step out of character immediately—wash your face, change clothes
☐ Do something fun and light to return to yourself
☐ Celebrate that you were brave enough to go there
☐ Let it go. You've done your part. The rest is out of your hands.
Final Words from Your Coach:

Juniper Jamieson is a gift of a role. She's the kind of character that could define a career. But here's the thing: she doesn't need you to PERFORM her. She needs you to BECOME her. To find the part of yourself that knows what it means to love hard, hurt quietly, and show up anyway. To access the strength it takes to choose kindness when the world has been cruel.

You're not auditioning to be perfect. You're auditioning to be REAL. To be present. To be so deeply THERE that casting forgets they're watching an audition and starts believing they're watching Juniper's life unfold.

So here's my challenge to you: Stop acting. Start living. Walk into that room (or that self-tape) and LIVE as Juniper for three minutes. Let her breathe through you. Let her hope through you. Let her love through you.

And when you're done? When you've given them everything you've got?

Let it go. Release it. Trust that if this role is meant for you, it will find you.

Now go show them a Juniper they'll never forget.
