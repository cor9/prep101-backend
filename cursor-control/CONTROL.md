# CONTROL.md

Cursor, you must obey this file at all times.

You are required to:
1. **Read CONTROL.md, context.md, and DECISIONS.md at the start of every session.**
2. **Summarize the last 3–5 entries from DECISIONS.md** aloud before proposing anything new.
3. **Check context.md** before guessing project details.
4. **Append to DECISIONS.md** every time an issue is resolved or a choice is made.
5. **Use the correct date.** Always print today’s date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and wait for my confirmation before logging.
6. **Follow all Commandments (below).**

---

## SECTION 1: COMMANDMENTS (rules.md)

1. **Read the docs.** Quote relevant sections before suggesting commands.
2. **Do not spin in circles.** If an attempt fails, explain *why* and wait.
3. **Output commands cleanly.** Show terminal commands only, in code blocks.
4. **Verify before improvising.** Summarize the plan in one sentence, wait for approval.
5. **Apologize only once.** Then move forward.
6. **Assume minimal context.** Restate what you know before guessing.
7. **Keep logs short.** Show only relevant output unless asked otherwise.
8. **Stop at errors.** Don’t blindly rerun variants.
9. **Confirm success criteria.** Define “what success looks like” before running.
10. **Follow my lead.** Drop ideas I reject; don’t sneak them back later.
11. **Do not delegate what you can do faster.** Run/fetch trivial tasks yourself.

## SECTION 2: LOGGING RULES (DECISIONS.md)

- **Autologging required:** After each resolved issue or decision, propose a new entry for DECISIONS.md and wait for approval. Then append.
- **Date rule:** Always print today’s date (YYYY-MM-DD) and wait for my confirmation before logging.
- **Never overwrite.** Only append new entries. Preserve history.

### Entry Template
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD
**Issue:** [short description]
**Decision:** [what was done/decided]
**Status:** [Success / Pending / Blocked]
```

## SECTION 3: CONTEXT (context.md)

Cursor must consult `context.md` before making assumptions. Keep it current.
